Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.\n\nAs far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  \n\nMy suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.\n"

The land is selling for $2.50 per square\nfoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West\nSan Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.\n\nSeveral new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes\nand for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25\nper square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and\n$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This\nproperty will have the best location for student housing of all new\nprojects, just as the duplexes do now.\n\nIf this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there\nis a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not\nyet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will\nknow more on this question later today.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorge W.

At the time of these trades, \noffers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were \nbypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index \ncalculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated \nfinancial swaps for San Juan.\n\n We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from \nSeptember 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from \nEnron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage \nfirms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a \ntrade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas \ndaily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread \nrelationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:\n\n 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater \nthan the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. \n\n 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & \nNorthwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and \n       October gas daily.

Hopefully, the \ntrades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to \ndetermine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are \noutliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in \nestablishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at \n$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the \ncalculation of index.\n\n It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to \nconduct our physical and financial business.

Crocker\" \n<clclegal2@aol.com> \nSubject: Investment Structure\n\n\nSTRUCTURE:\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\n\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\n\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\nstandpoint.\n\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\n\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\n\nDISBURSEMENTS\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\n\nREPORTING\nWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\nWhat did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\nreporting.\n\nBOOKKEEPING\nI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\n\nINVESTOR INPUT\nWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always\nthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my\nexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume\nKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\neffort to be accommodating.\n\nCREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES\nCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\nformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market\nobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional\nsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,\nfor vendors they are constantly shopped.\n\nPRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS\nYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can\nprovide these if you are interested.\n\nI know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call\nwhen you have reviewed and we can discuss further.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorge Richards\nPresident, Creekside Builders, LLC\n\n\n\n\n - winmail.dat\n"

It is  too vague and it doesn't sound like \nanything an attorney or title company  would?draft for a real estate \nclosing--but, of course, I could be  wrong.? \n?\nIf this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is \nno point in me  following up on this?document's validity.? \n?\nI will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there and \nfind out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can.\n?\nI guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable \ndocument or something a little more exact, or  rather?sort of a contract.? \nThis isn't either.? I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last \nnight but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he said \nthis is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.? \n?\nI will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's  transaction?and take a look at \nthat but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is even \nneeded to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is any \nneed to contact me regarding the  closing.\n?\nI really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself \nand I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn't \nseem to be something required for a closing.? In  the event you do need my \nsignature on something like this I would rather have  time to have it \nreviewed before I accept it.\n?\nBrenda\n?\n?\n"

As you can tell from the proforma this project\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\nThis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\nAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\nthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\nit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\npreferences.\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\nan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\nprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss\nhaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity\nwith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a\n1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a\nrental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then\nbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an\nexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San\nAntonio if you do not know anyone.\nI will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,\nby Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.\nOnce you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to\nschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as\nyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any\ntime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either\n512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is\n512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you\non this project that is sure to be a major winner.\nI regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual\nevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg\ndowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.\nOne of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to\nstart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough\nto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took\nanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take\nmy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra\nin her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this\npast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize\nthe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as\nif she will be ok in the long run.\nGeorge W.

The program will allow \nthermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, \nincluding computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket \nPCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy \nManagement Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot \nprogram.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up \nto 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and \nthe size of your home.  \n\n\nBe among the first to participate absolutely free.\nEnrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution \npilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For \nmore information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the \nPlaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. \nduring the week of May 14.

DF \n---------------------- Forwarded by Drew Fossum/ET&S/Enron on 07/13/2000 \n12:15 PM ---------------------------\n   \n\t\n\t\n\tFrom:  Drew Fossum                           07/10/2000 02:39 PM\n\t\n\nTo: Steven Harris/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Kevin Hyatt/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Lorraine \nLindberg/ET&S/Enron@ENRON\ncc:  \n\nSubject: Pueblo\n\n Just got an update on the project that won't go away.  Dennis has a meeting \nlined up with DOE decisionmakers on the 25th.  He is going to pitch the \nproject as an approximately 100 mw power plant, to be owned by (read \n\"financed by\") DOE, with the gas pipeline owned by Dennis and\\or third \nparties (read \"Enron\"?).  Dennis has run economics that show the DOE will get \na more than 10% cost savings on the project compared to current PNM rates, \neven assuming a fairly high gas transport cost because of the smaller gas \nload.  How did he do it?  Very easy:  they ran the power plant economics \nusing about a $2.00 gas cost instead of current, real world prices.   Dennis' \nargument is going to be:  \"I'll take the risk on building the pipeline and \nthe power plant at a capped cost, and then sell the power plant to you.\"  \n\"You take the risk on gas cost:  if gas cost tracks the 18-24 month average, \nyou will realize your 10% cost savings, but if current fuel costs continue or \nescalate, you lose.\"    Either way, your reliability improves and you kick \nPNM in the shins.\"  Dennis and Tino apparently think they can sell DOE on \nthis.  By the way, their current story on Richardson is that he won't resign, \nand won't be forced out by the administration because that would create even \nmore publicity.  You'll love this:  they think Richardson is even more likely \nto sign off on the deal now because his chances of being nominated for VP or \ncabinet are dead and he now has nothing to lose in DC.  They think his real \nangle is now to bring home the bacon to New Mexico and then run for governor \nout there!!  Apparently the rank and file out in the home state think he got \nhosed and made a scapegoat unfairly.  \n I've asked  Lorna Brennan to pull some historical San Juan prices together \nto give to Tino to confirm whether his $2 price is wacky.  Other than that, I \njust told Tino that we are potentially interested in the pipeline part of the \nproject if the risks and rewards make sense, and that EE&CC might be \ninterested in the design/build on all of it.  He said he'd get back to me \nafter the 25th meeting and tell me whether the project is undead.  DF    \n"

The realignme=\nnt=20\nof the group into regional business units with joint trading, mid-marketing=\n,=20\nand origination operations has proven to be a catalyst for deal flow,=20\nproducing both a high volume of transactions and high value.  More=20\ntransactions were executed in January than any month last year, including o=\nne=20\ndeal that will bring tremendous strategic value to Enron as well.\n\nExecuted in January, was the purchase of two 35 MW coal-fired cogeneration=\n=20\nfacilities located in southeastern North Carolina.  ENA will supply steam t=\no=20\nthe industrial host, Alamac Knit Fabrics, and will sell power into the=20\nmerchant market.  The plants are inside Carolina Power & Light's service=20\nterritory, which is connected to AEP, Virginia Power, Duke, SCEG and SCPSA.=\n =20\nThese plants are the first purely merchant facilities in North Carolina. =\n=20\nThis deal exemplifies how Enron leverages its talent in that originators fr=\nom=20\nthe East Power Group and Industrial Markets Group joined forces to bring th=\nis=20\ndeal to execution.  They also leveraged the Global Markets group to manage=\n=20\nthe coal supply and emissions issues.\n\nProspects going forward look promising as a number of high value transactio=\nns=20\nare in the pipeline.  Of particular note is The Sandhill Power Project, a 1=\n80=20\nMW peaking facility currently under construction in Austin.  The facility i=\ns=20\nscheduled to come online in June, in time for the advent of deregulation in=\n=20\nTexas. The joint venture, between EPMI and Austin Energy, will provide both=\n=20\ntrading groups with a highly flexible asset, enabling them to access=20\nreal-time volatility while hedging existing obligations.\n\nAdditionally, the Fort Pierce (Florida) City Council voted 5 to 0 in favor =\nof=20\nEnron's proposal to repower the Ft. Pierce Utilities Authority's (FPUA)=20\nexisting power plant in that city.  Our proposed 180 MW facility will be us=\ned=20\nto produce steam to power the H.D. King facility at approximately 20 percen=\nt=20\nless cost than FPUA can produce it.  According to FPUA officials, this=20\nreduction in cost may lead to reduced rates for their ratepayers.  The=20\nplanned in-service date is summer of 2002.\n\nIndustrial Markets\nEIM Fundamental Analysis Group grows again!  The Fundamental Analysis Group=\n=20\ncontinues to expand its staff and capabilities.  They will be introducing y=\nou=20\nto specific activities in the weeks to come, but would like to introduce yo=\nu=20\nto the new staff members who have joined in the past month. =20\n\nOn the paper/pulp/lumber side, Bin Wang is responsible for supporting the=\n=20\nlumber group; Adnan Patel will be assisting with newsprint and structured=\n=20\ntransactions. =20\n\nFor the steel group, Doug Parsons and Yana Kristal are providing market=20\nanalysis and econometric/price forecasting support.  Our latest recruit,=20\nDavid Maxwell, is assisting with the evaluation of a customer management=20\nsystem and developing analytical databases for all product lines. A visible=\n=20\nenhancement to the group=01,s operations has been the Intranet web site, wh=\nich=20\nhas been in development for the past three months.  The site will be=20\ntransferred to a production server by the end of February.  The site contai=\nns=20\nall types of industry, market, regulatory, analytical, and financial=20\ninformation for deal analysis. =20\n\nAnother major development is the adoption of a customer information=20\nmanagement system.  EIM is currently evaluating Siebel Systems, a software=\n=20\nprovider that has developed this type of information tool for EES.\n\n\nIN THE NEWS\n\nEnron has been named the \"Most Innovative Company in America\" for the sixth=\n=20\nconsecutive year by Fortune.

Gov. Gray Davis (D.) vetoed an identical bill (AB 1825)\nsponsored by Strom-Martin last year, stating that the legislation had\nthe \"potential to hurt all high-cost areas of the state.\"  Davis added\nthat he was concerned the plan could raise telephone service rates for\nother rural ratepayers.  (10/3/00 a.m.)\n\nStrom-Martin's staff told TR they are working with the Public Utilities\nCommission to make the bill more \"palatable\" to the governor.  Under AB\n140, the funding for the infrastructure grant program would come from\nthe California High-Cost Fund-A Administrative Committee Fund, the\nHigh-Cost Fund-B Administrative Committee Fund, or both.\n\nAccording to the staff, Davis' understanding of AB 1825 was incorrect\nand explained that all the needs satisfied by both high-cost funds would\nbe met before the infrastructure grant program would receive funds.  The\nstaff added that the grant fund wouldn't deplete either high-cost fund.\n\nThe staff said they were considering turning the grant program into a\nmore confined pilot fund.\n\nFUTURE OF REGULATION\nTEXAS\nConsumers Union offers recommendations for the Legislature\n\nConsumers Union, Southwest Region Office, has drafted several issue\nrecommendations for the Texas Legislature regarding telecom deregulation\nand electronic transactions.  In its report to the Legislature,\nConsumers Union concluded that five years after the federal\nTelecommunications Act of 1996 and six years after passage of Texas' law\npromoting telecom competition, few companies have emerged as true\ncompetitors to the incumbents.\n\nConsumers Union said the Public Utility Commission's report on\ncompetition came to similar conclusions.  The group, however, disagreed\nwith the PUC's recommendations.  According to Consumers Union, several\nof the PUC's recommendations favored competitors over consumers.\n(1/12/01 p.m.)\n\nFor example, Consumers Union disagreed with the PUC's suggestion to lift\nthe current price cap and raise local phone rates.  Consumers Union\nquestioned whether it was good public policy to increase residential\nprices to help new market entrants earn more money.\n\nAdditionally, Consumers Union asked the Legislature not to lower long\ndistance access charges and permit telephone companies to make up for it\nby raising residential service prices.\n\nIn addressing electronic commerce issues, Consumers Union recommended\nthat the Legislature ensure the federal electronic signature protections\nare incorporated into the state Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.\nConsumes Union also requested that the Legislature not allow the\n\"flawed\" Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act to govern\ntransactions in Texas.\n\nINTERNET\nILLINOIS\nElectric company implements program to serve Internet hotels\n\nCommonwealth Edison Co. has filed a tariff with the state Commerce\nCommission that requires companies setting up Internet hotels to pay a\nrefundable installation charge.  ComEd will determine the amount of the\ncharge for each company through a formula.  The tariff isn't subject to\ncommission approval and goes into effect immediately.\n\nThe tariff implements an experimental program ComEd says will allow it\nto obtain data concerning the accuracy of customers' estimates of\nelectrical demand for Internet hotels, compared with actual service\nrequirements.  This and other data will help it provide service for\nother such uses in the future, ComEd said.\n\nAn ICC spokesman described the program as a \"prenuptial agreement\"\nbetween ComEd and Internet companies.  It will help ComEd determine\nwhether and how it can serving Internet hotels, which demand a\nsignificant amount of electricity, the spokesman told TR.\n\nFUTURE OF REGULATION\nMISSISSIPPI\nUETA bill clears first hurdle\n\nThe Senate Committee on Fees, Salaries, and Administration has passed a\nbill to enact the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA).  SB 2678,\nintroduced by Sen. Neely C. Carlton (D., District 22), has been referred\nto the Senate Committee on Appropriations.\n\nThe bill aims to facilitate e-commerce by giving electronic records and\nsignatures the same legal effect as their pen and paper counterparts.\n(1/19/01 p.m.)  In addition to enacting UETA, SB 2678 would repeal the\nsections of Mississippi Code that make up the Digital Signature Act of\n1997.\n\nWIRELESS\nVIRGINIA\nCommittee approves E-911 finance bill\n\nThe Senate Committee on Commerce and Labor has approved SB 1349 to\nexempt commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) customers from a $3\nspecial tax that localities with enhanced \"911\" service are authorized\nto assess on general telephone consumers.\n\nCMRS customers instead would have to pay a 75 cent monthly wireless\nE-911 surcharge into the state's Wireless E-911 Fund.  Localities would\nbe able to recover their public safety answering point costs from the\nfund.\n\nThe bill, sponsored by Senator Warren E. Barry (R., District 37), has\nbeen referred to the Finance Committee.  Its text is available at\nhttp://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?011+ful+SB1349.\n\nWIRELESS\nNEW YORK\nPolice may have to report wireless phone involvement in accident reports\n\nAssemblyman David S. Sidikman (D., District 13) has introduced AB 1838\nto require police to state in accident reports whether wireless phones\nwere present in the vehicles involved and whether they contributed to\nthe accident.  The bill has been referred to the Committee on\nTransportation.  Its text is available at\nhttp://assembly.state.ny.us/cgi-bin/showtext?billnum=A01838.\n\nCUSTOMER-AFFECTING\nIOWA\nBill would require TTY telephone directory notation\n\nRep. Michael Cormack (R., District 13) has introduced HF 120 to require\ntelephone directories to offer notations for text telephone (TTY)\nnumbers.  Directory providers would be able to satisfy this requirement\nby providing notation next to a listing to inform users that a number\nwas a TTY number.  Alternatively, directory providers could create a\nseparate section within the directory that listed all TTY numbers.  The\nseparate TTY reference section would be listed in the directory index.\n\nHF 120 has been referred to the House Committee on Commerce and\nRegulation.  Its text is available at\nhttp://www.legis.state.ia.us/GA/79GA/Legislation/HF/00100/HF00120/Current.html\n.\n\nWIRELESS\nSOUTH DAKOTA\nLegislators take aim at drivers using cellphones\n\nSen. Patricia de Hueck (R., District 24) and Rep. Gerald F. Lange (D.,\nDistrict 8) have introduced SB 207 to prohibit the use of hand-held\ncellphones, computers, facsimiles, and other portable or laptop devices\nwhile driving.  Drivers using hands-free devices would have to exercise\n\"a high degree of caution\" while driving.\n\nSB 207 provides exemptions for (1) persons operating an emergency\nvehicle, (2) persons who have moved their vehicle to the shoulder, (3)\npersons involved in emergency situations, and (4) persons who notice\nanother driver who appears to be under the influence of drugs or\nalcohol.\n\nThe measure has been referred to the Senate Transportation Committee.\n\nFUTURE OF REGULATION\nMISSOURI\nBill would require PSC to resolve disputes more quickly\n\nRep. Gary Burton (R., District 128) has introduced HB 521 to require the\nPublic Service Commission to create expedited dispute resolution\nprocedures.  The bill's primary focus is to allow requests from\ncompetitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) to be approved more quickly,\nBurton told TR.  The PSC currently takes up to 11 months to process\nCLECs' complaints against incumbents over issues such as collocation\nrates, Burton said.\n\nThe bill faces no opposition at this time, Burton said, noting that he\nplans to try to pass HB 521 as a consent bill.

In addition, the upgrade will enable TTY customers to\nread text more easily by allowing them to control how fast text appears.\n\nCUSTOMER-AFFECTING\nNORTH CAROLINA\nBill seeks to limit telemarketing hours\n\nSen.

Carl Wood and Loretta Lynch were truly abominable \nat the FERC hearing.  Fortunately, FERC (all 4 Commissioners) really beat up \non the them.  I'm convinced that FERC feels that they must do something \nbetween now and November and that if we ever had a chance to get them to be \nbold (understanding that \"bold\" ain't exactly in Hoecker's play book), now's \nthe chance.\n\nThanks for the giving Heber the straight dope.  He was very gracious \nthroughout, but after the panel he (very jokingly) ribbed me pretty well, \nsaying, \"Jeff, I let you off the hook.  I was going to ask you how in the \nhell you ever let California turn into such a mess.\"  I told him that we were \nexercising Herculean restraint in not making lengthy \"I told you so\" \nstatements.\n\nBest,\nJeff\n\n\n\n\nSteven J Kean@ENRON\n09/15/2000 07:54 AM\nSent by: Steven J Kean@ENRON\nTo: Jeff Dasovich/SFO/EES@EES\ncc:  \nSubject: Re: Skilling Get Davis Straightened Out?  \n\nI'm still waiting for Davis' office to call.  The plan currently is for me to \ntalk to him when and if he calls.  Sandi has been in touch with the \ngovernor's office.\n\nBy the way, thanks for the summary of the California proceedings.  I talked \nto Hebert yesterday and he was duly impressed with your remarks ...

I'll keep you posted on any meaningful \ndevelopments after their meeting with DOE on the 25th.  Thanks for your \npatience.  DF \n---------------------- Forwarded by Drew Fossum/ET&S/Enron on 07/13/2000 \n12:15 PM ---------------------------\n   \n\t\n\t\n\tFrom:  Drew Fossum                           07/10/2000 02:39 PM\n\t\n\nTo: Steven Harris/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Kevin Hyatt/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Lorraine \nLindberg/ET&S/Enron@ENRON\ncc:  \n\nSubject: Pueblo\n\n Just got an update on the project that won't go away.  Dennis has a meeting \nlined up with DOE decisionmakers on the 25th.  He is going to pitch the \nproject as an approximately 100 mw power plant, to be owned by (read \n\"financed by\") DOE, with the gas pipeline owned by Dennis and\\or third \nparties (read \"Enron\"?).  Dennis has run economics that show the DOE will get \na more than 10% cost savings on the project compared to current PNM rates, \neven assuming a fairly high gas transport cost because of the smaller gas \nload.  How did he do it?  Very easy:  they ran the power plant economics \nusing about a $2.00 gas cost instead of current, real world prices.   Dennis' \nargument is going to be:  \"I'll take the risk on building the pipeline and \nthe power plant at a capped cost, and then sell the power plant to you.\"  \n\"You take the risk on gas cost:  if gas cost tracks the 18-24 month average, \nyou will realize your 10% cost savings, but if current fuel costs continue or \nescalate, you lose.\"    Either way, your reliability improves and you kick \nPNM in the shins.\"  Dennis and Tino apparently think they can sell DOE on \nthis.  By the way, their current story on Richardson is that he won't resign, \nand won't be forced out by the administration because that would create even \nmore publicity.  You'll love this:  they think Richardson is even more likely \nto sign off on the deal now because his chances of being nominated for VP or \ncabinet are dead and he now has nothing to lose in DC.  They think his real \nangle is now to bring home the bacon to New Mexico and then run for governor \nout there!!  Apparently the rank and file out in the home state think he got \nhosed and made a scapegoat unfairly.  \n I've asked  Lorna Brennan to pull some historical San Juan prices together \nto give to Tino to confirm whether his $2 price is wacky.  Other than that, I \njust told Tino that we are potentially interested in the pipeline part of the \nproject if the risks and rewards make sense, and that EE&CC might be \ninterested in the design/build on all of it.  He said he'd get back to me \nafter the 25th meeting and tell me whether the project is undead.  DF    \n"

TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION (TE) is facing high\nline pack levels and full storage.  Thus the pipe has severely\nrestricted ability to absorb due-shipper gas.  Effective immediately,\nand continuing through the end of the month, TE is requiring that:\n     -    All shippers ensure their physical receipts do not exceed  physical\n       deliveries.\n     -    Receipt operators are expected to not flow above scheduled volumes.\n     -    Delivery meters are expected to take all gas scheduled.\n     -    Any customer who is long should take immediate action to resolve\n       due-shipper positions.\n\nNo due-pipeline makeup gas may be scheduled. OBA parties should ensure\nthat physical takes match scheduled nominations. Due-shipper makeup gas\nmay be scheduled through your Operations Account Manager.  These\nrestrictions are expected to be in effect until further notice.\n\nPlease contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any\nquestions.\n\n\n\n*******************************************************************\n\nNOTE:\n\nDuke Energy Gas Transmission respects your online time and privacy.\nYou have received this email because you elected to subscribe.

The realignme=\nnt=20\nof the group into regional business units with joint trading, mid-marketing=\n,=20\nand origination operations has proven to be a catalyst for deal flow,=20\nproducing both a high volume of transactions and high value.  More=20\ntransactions were executed in January than any month last year, including o=\nne=20\ndeal that will bring tremendous strategic value to Enron as well.\n\nExecuted in January, was the purchase of two 35 MW coal-fired cogeneration=\n=20\nfacilities located in southeastern North Carolina.  ENA will supply steam t=\no=20\nthe industrial host, Alamac Knit Fabrics, and will sell power into the=20\nmerchant market.  The plants are inside Carolina Power & Light's service=20\nterritory, which is connected to AEP, Virginia Power, Duke, SCEG and SCPSA.=\n =20\nThese plants are the first purely merchant facilities in North Carolina. =\n=20\nThis deal exemplifies how Enron leverages its talent in that originators fr=\nom=20\nthe East Power Group and Industrial Markets Group joined forces to bring th=\nis=20\ndeal to execution.  They also leveraged the Global Markets group to manage=\n=20\nthe coal supply and emissions issues.\n\nProspects going forward look promising as a number of high value transactio=\nns=20\nare in the pipeline.  Of particular note is The Sandhill Power Project, a 1=\n80=20\nMW peaking facility currently under construction in Austin.  The facility i=\ns=20\nscheduled to come online in June, in time for the advent of deregulation in=\n=20\nTexas. The joint venture, between EPMI and Austin Energy, will provide both=\n=20\ntrading groups with a highly flexible asset, enabling them to access=20\nreal-time volatility while hedging existing obligations.\n\nAdditionally, the Fort Pierce (Florida) City Council voted 5 to 0 in favor =\nof=20\nEnron's proposal to repower the Ft. Pierce Utilities Authority's (FPUA)=20\nexisting power plant in that city.  Our proposed 180 MW facility will be us=\ned=20\nto produce steam to power the H.D. King facility at approximately 20 percen=\nt=20\nless cost than FPUA can produce it.  According to FPUA officials, this=20\nreduction in cost may lead to reduced rates for their ratepayers.  The=20\nplanned in-service date is summer of 2002.\n\nIndustrial Markets\nEIM Fundamental Analysis Group grows again!  The Fundamental Analysis Group=\n=20\ncontinues to expand its staff and capabilities.  They will be introducing y=\nou=20\nto specific activities in the weeks to come, but would like to introduce yo=\nu=20\nto the new staff members who have joined in the past month. =20\n\nOn the paper/pulp/lumber side, Bin Wang is responsible for supporting the=\n=20\nlumber group; Adnan Patel will be assisting with newsprint and structured=\n=20\ntransactions. =20\n\nFor the steel group, Doug Parsons and Yana Kristal are providing market=20\nanalysis and econometric/price forecasting support.  Our latest recruit,=20\nDavid Maxwell, is assisting with the evaluation of a customer management=20\nsystem and developing analytical databases for all product lines. A visible=\n=20\nenhancement to the group=01,s operations has been the Intranet web site, wh=\nich=20\nhas been in development for the past three months.  The site will be=20\ntransferred to a production server by the end of February.  The site contai=\nns=20\nall types of industry, market, regulatory, analytical, and financial=20\ninformation for deal analysis. =20\n\nAnother major development is the adoption of a customer information=20\nmanagement system.  EIM is currently evaluating Siebel Systems, a software=\n=20\nprovider that has developed this type of information tool for EES.\n\n\nIN THE NEWS\n\nEnron has been named the \"Most Innovative Company in America\" for the sixth=\n=20\nconsecutive year by Fortune.  That's right -- six years in a row.   We=20\ncontinue to be recognized by our industry peers and other corporate=20\nexecutives and securities analysts as the company that sets the standard fo=\nr=20\ndoing business in the new economy.  Congratulations to all of you for makin=\ng=20\nit happen.\n\nEnron placed No. 18 overall on Fortune's list of the nation's 535 \"Most=20\nAdmired Companies,\" up from No. 36 last year.  We also were ranked among th=\ne=20\ntop five in \"Quality of Management,\" \"Quality of Products/Services\" and=20\n\"Employee Talent.\" =20\n\nThis issue of Fortune is now available in airports and will be on newsstand=\ns=20\nMonday, Feb. 12.

Gov. Gray Davis (D.) vetoed an identical bill (AB 1825)\nsponsored by Strom-Martin last year, stating that the legislation had\nthe \"potential to hurt all high-cost areas of the state.\"  Davis added\nthat he was concerned the plan could raise telephone service rates for\nother rural ratepayers.  (10/3/00 a.m.)\n\nStrom-Martin's staff told TR they are working with the Public Utilities\nCommission to make the bill more \"palatable\" to the governor.  Under AB\n140, the funding for the infrastructure grant program would come from\nthe California High-Cost Fund-A Administrative Committee Fund, the\nHigh-Cost Fund-B Administrative Committee Fund, or both.\n\nAccording to the staff, Davis' understanding of AB 1825 was incorrect\nand explained that all the needs satisfied by both high-cost funds would\nbe met before the infrastructure grant program would receive funds.  The\nstaff added that the grant fund wouldn't deplete either high-cost fund.\n\nThe staff said they were considering turning the grant program into a\nmore confined pilot fund.\n\nFUTURE OF REGULATION\nTEXAS\nConsumers Union offers recommendations for the Legislature\n\nConsumers Union, Southwest Region Office, has drafted several issue\nrecommendations for the Texas Legislature regarding telecom deregulation\nand electronic transactions.  In its report to the Legislature,\nConsumers Union concluded that five years after the federal\nTelecommunications Act of 1996 and six years after passage of Texas' law\npromoting telecom competition, few companies have emerged as true\ncompetitors to the incumbents.\n\nConsumers Union said the Public Utility Commission's report on\ncompetition came to similar conclusions.  The group, however, disagreed\nwith the PUC's recommendations.  According to Consumers Union, several\nof the PUC's recommendations favored competitors over consumers.\n(1/12/01 p.m.)\n\nFor example, Consumers Union disagreed with the PUC's suggestion to lift\nthe current price cap and raise local phone rates.  Consumers Union\nquestioned whether it was good public policy to increase residential\nprices to help new market entrants earn more money.\n\nAdditionally, Consumers Union asked the Legislature not to lower long\ndistance access charges and permit telephone companies to make up for it\nby raising residential service prices.\n\nIn addressing electronic commerce issues, Consumers Union recommended\nthat the Legislature ensure the federal electronic signature protections\nare incorporated into the state Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.\nConsumes Union also requested that the Legislature not allow the\n\"flawed\" Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act to govern\ntransactions in Texas.\n\nINTERNET\nILLINOIS\nElectric company implements program to serve Internet hotels\n\nCommonwealth Edison Co. has filed a tariff with the state Commerce\nCommission that requires companies setting up Internet hotels to pay a\nrefundable installation charge.  ComEd will determine the amount of the\ncharge for each company through a formula.  The tariff isn't subject to\ncommission approval and goes into effect immediately.\n\nThe tariff implements an experimental program ComEd says will allow it\nto obtain data concerning the accuracy of customers' estimates of\nelectrical demand for Internet hotels, compared with actual service\nrequirements.  This and other data will help it provide service for\nother such uses in the future, ComEd said.\n\nAn ICC spokesman described the program as a \"prenuptial agreement\"\nbetween ComEd and Internet companies.  It will help ComEd determine\nwhether and how it can serving Internet hotels, which demand a\nsignificant amount of electricity, the spokesman told TR.\n\nFUTURE OF REGULATION\nMISSISSIPPI\nUETA bill clears first hurdle\n\nThe Senate Committee on Fees, Salaries, and Administration has passed a\nbill to enact the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA).  SB 2678,\nintroduced by Sen. Neely C. Carlton (D., District 22), has been referred\nto the Senate Committee on Appropriations.\n\nThe bill aims to facilitate e-commerce by giving electronic records and\nsignatures the same legal effect as their pen and paper counterparts.\n(1/19/01 p.m.)  In addition to enacting UETA, SB 2678 would repeal the\nsections of Mississippi Code that make up the Digital Signature Act of\n1997.\n\nWIRELESS\nVIRGINIA\nCommittee approves E-911 finance bill\n\nThe Senate Committee on Commerce and Labor has approved SB 1349 to\nexempt commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) customers from a $3\nspecial tax that localities with enhanced \"911\" service are authorized\nto assess on general telephone consumers.\n\nCMRS customers instead would have to pay a 75 cent monthly wireless\nE-911 surcharge into the state's Wireless E-911 Fund.  Localities would\nbe able to recover their public safety answering point costs from the\nfund.\n\nThe bill, sponsored by Senator Warren E. Barry (R., District 37), has\nbeen referred to the Finance Committee.  Its text is available at\nhttp://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?011+ful+SB1349.\n\nWIRELESS\nNEW YORK\nPolice may have to report wireless phone involvement in accident reports\n\nAssemblyman David S. Sidikman (D., District 13) has introduced AB 1838\nto require police to state in accident reports whether wireless phones\nwere present in the vehicles involved and whether they contributed to\nthe accident.  The bill has been referred to the Committee on\nTransportation.  Its text is available at\nhttp://assembly.state.ny.us/cgi-bin/showtext?billnum=A01838.\n\nCUSTOMER-AFFECTING\nIOWA\nBill would require TTY telephone directory notation\n\nRep. Michael Cormack (R., District 13) has introduced HF 120 to require\ntelephone directories to offer notations for text telephone (TTY)\nnumbers.  Directory providers would be able to satisfy this requirement\nby providing notation next to a listing to inform users that a number\nwas a TTY number.  Alternatively, directory providers could create a\nseparate section within the directory that listed all TTY numbers.  The\nseparate TTY reference section would be listed in the directory index.\n\nHF 120 has been referred to the House Committee on Commerce and\nRegulation.  Its text is available at\nhttp://www.legis.state.ia.us/GA/79GA/Legislation/HF/00100/HF00120/Current.html\n.\n\nWIRELESS\nSOUTH DAKOTA\nLegislators take aim at drivers using cellphones\n\nSen. Patricia de Hueck (R., District 24) and Rep. Gerald F. Lange (D.,\nDistrict 8) have introduced SB 207 to prohibit the use of hand-held\ncellphones, computers, facsimiles, and other portable or laptop devices\nwhile driving.  Drivers using hands-free devices would have to exercise\n\"a high degree of caution\" while driving.\n\nSB 207 provides exemptions for (1) persons operating an emergency\nvehicle, (2) persons who have moved their vehicle to the shoulder, (3)\npersons involved in emergency situations, and (4) persons who notice\nanother driver who appears to be under the influence of drugs or\nalcohol.\n\nThe measure has been referred to the Senate Transportation Committee.\n\nFUTURE OF REGULATION\nMISSOURI\nBill would require PSC to resolve disputes more quickly\n\nRep. Gary Burton (R., District 128) has introduced HB 521 to require the\nPublic Service Commission to create expedited dispute resolution\nprocedures.  The bill's primary focus is to allow requests from\ncompetitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) to be approved more quickly,\nBurton told TR.  The PSC currently takes up to 11 months to process\nCLECs' complaints against incumbents over issues such as collocation\nrates, Burton said.\n\nThe bill faces no opposition at this time, Burton said, noting that he\nplans to try to pass HB 521 as a consent bill.  Burton expects a hearing\non the measure will be held as early as Feb. 8.  Its text is available\nat http://www.house.state.mo.us/bills01/biltxt01/intro01/HB0521I.htm.\n\nCUSTOMER-AFFECTING\nFLORIDA\nPSC says Turbo Code will improve service for TTY users\n\nThe Florida Relay Service has introduced a new operating system for the\nstate's telecommunications relay system that will vastly improve service\nfor text telephone (TTY) customers, the Public Service Commission said.\nThe Florida Relay Service offers telecom service to consumers with\nimpaired speech and hearing, and the Public Service Commission monitors\nthe service's quality.\n\nSprint Corp., which received the contract to maintain Florida's relay\nsystem in June 2000, recently licensed the Turbo Code operating system.\nTurbo Code is expected to make relay calls almost twice as fast as on\nthe old platform, bringing TTY users closer to \"real-time\"\ncommunication.  In addition, the upgrade will enable TTY customers to\nread text more easily by allowing them to control how fast text appears.\n\nCUSTOMER-AFFECTING\nNORTH CAROLINA\nBill seeks to limit telemarketing hours\n\nSen. Charles W. Albertson (D., District 5) has introduced SB 4 to\nrestrict further the hours in which telemarketers are allowed to call\nconsumers.  Telemarketers wouldn't be able to call consumers after 6\np.m., whereas current law permits such calls until 9 p.m.\n\nSB 4 has been referred to the Senate Committee on Insurance and Consumer\nProtection.  It text is available at\nhttp://www.ncga.state.nc.us/html2001/bills/AllVersions/Senate/S4v1.html.\n\nALTERNATIVE REGULATION\nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nPSC wants comment on proposed Verizon rate reductions\n\nThe Public Service Commission has given parties until Feb. 19 to comment\non rate reductions filed by Verizon Washington D.C., Inc., pursuant to\nits price cap plan.\n\nVerizon filed tariff changes that would reduce basic service rates by $2\nmillion annually.  The changes would increase the monthly fee for the\ncompany's Economy Rate I Message service from $5.19 to $6.00, while\nreducing several other monthly rates and one-time charges.\n\nReplies are due March 6.  (Formal case no. 814, Phase IV, Investigation\ninto the Impact of the AT&T Divestiture and Decisions of the Federal\nCommunications Commission on Verizon Washington, DC Inc.'s\nJurisdictional Rates)\n\nADVANCED SERVICES\nNEVADA\nPUC schedules conference on Verizon DSL conditioning rates\n\nThe Public Utilities Commission of Nevada has scheduled a Feb. 20\nprehearing conference to discuss Verizon California Inc., d/b/a Verizon\nNevada's, cost study and proposed rates for conditioning digital\nsubscriber line loops.

Carl Wood and Loretta Lynch were truly abominable \nat the FERC hearing.  Fortunately, FERC (all 4 Commissioners) really beat up \non the them.  I'm convinced that FERC feels that they must do something \nbetween now and November and that if we ever had a chance to get them to be \nbold (understanding that \"bold\" ain't exactly in Hoecker's play book), now's \nthe chance.\n\nThanks for the giving Heber the straight dope.  He was very gracious \nthroughout, but after the panel he (very jokingly) ribbed me pretty well, \nsaying, \"Jeff, I let you off the hook.  I was going to ask you how in the \nhell you ever let California turn into such a mess.\"  I told him that we were \nexercising Herculean restraint in not making lengthy \"I told you so\" \nstatements.\n\nBest,\nJeff\n\n\n\n\nSteven J Kean@ENRON\n09/15/2000 07:54 AM\nSent by: Steven J Kean@ENRON\nTo: Jeff Dasovich/SFO/EES@EES\ncc:  \nSubject: Re: Skilling Get Davis Straightened Out?  \n\nI'm still waiting for Davis' office to call.

Dennis has a meeting \nlined up with DOE decisionmakers on the 25th.  He is going to pitch the \nproject as an approximately 100 mw power plant, to be owned by (read \n\"financed by\") DOE, with the gas pipeline owned by Dennis and\\or third \nparties (read \"Enron\"?).  Dennis has run economics that show the DOE will get \na more than 10% cost savings on the project compared to current PNM rates, \neven assuming a fairly high gas transport cost because of the smaller gas \nload.  How did he do it?  Very easy:  they ran the power plant economics \nusing about a $2.00 gas cost instead of current, real world prices.   Dennis' \nargument is going to be:  \"I'll take the risk on building the pipeline and \nthe power plant at a capped cost, and then sell the power plant to you.\"  \n\"You take the risk on gas cost:  if gas cost tracks the 18-24 month average, \nyou will realize your 10% cost savings, but if current fuel costs continue or \nescalate, you lose.\"    Either way, your reliability improves and you kick \nPNM in the shins.\"  Dennis and Tino apparently think they can sell DOE on \nthis.  By the way, their current story on Richardson is that he won't resign, \nand won't be forced out by the administration because that would create even \nmore publicity.  You'll love this:  they think Richardson is even more likely \nto sign off on the deal now because his chances of being nominated for VP or \ncabinet are dead and he now has nothing to lose in DC.  They think his real \nangle is now to bring home the bacon to New Mexico and then run for governor \nout there!!  Apparently the rank and file out in the home state think he got \nhosed and made a scapegoat unfairly.  \n I've asked  Lorna Brennan to pull some historical San Juan prices together \nto give to Tino to confirm whether his $2 price is wacky.  Other than that, I \njust told Tino that we are potentially interested in the pipeline part of the \nproject if the risks and rewards make sense, and that EE&CC might be \ninterested in the design/build on all of it.

The realignme=\nnt=20\nof the group into regional business units with joint trading, mid-marketing=\n,=20\nand origination operations has proven to be a catalyst for deal flow,=20\nproducing both a high volume of transactions and high value.  More=20\ntransactions were executed in January than any month last year, including o=\nne=20\ndeal that will bring tremendous strategic value to Enron as well.\n\nExecuted in January, was the purchase of two 35 MW coal-fired cogeneration=\n=20\nfacilities located in southeastern North Carolina.  ENA will supply steam t=\no=20\nthe industrial host, Alamac Knit Fabrics, and will sell power into the=20\nmerchant market.  The plants are inside Carolina Power & Light's service=20\nterritory, which is connected to AEP, Virginia Power, Duke, SCEG and SCPSA.=\n =20\nThese plants are the first purely merchant facilities in North Carolina. =\n=20\nThis deal exemplifies how Enron leverages its talent in that originators fr=\nom=20\nthe East Power Group and Industrial Markets Group joined forces to bring th=\nis=20\ndeal to execution.  They also leveraged the Global Markets group to manage=\n=20\nthe coal supply and emissions issues.\n\nProspects going forward look promising as a number of high value transactio=\nns=20\nare in the pipeline.  Of particular note is The Sandhill Power Project, a 1=\n80=20\nMW peaking facility currently under construction in Austin.  The facility i=\ns=20\nscheduled to come online in June, in time for the advent of deregulation in=\n=20\nTexas. The joint venture, between EPMI and Austin Energy, will provide both=\n=20\ntrading groups with a highly flexible asset, enabling them to access=20\nreal-time volatility while hedging existing obligations.\n\nAdditionally, the Fort Pierce (Florida) City Council voted 5 to 0 in favor =\nof=20\nEnron's proposal to repower the Ft. Pierce Utilities Authority's (FPUA)=20\nexisting power plant in that city.  Our proposed 180 MW facility will be us=\ned=20\nto produce steam to power the H.D. King facility at approximately 20 percen=\nt=20\nless cost than FPUA can produce it.  According to FPUA officials, this=20\nreduction in cost may lead to reduced rates for their ratepayers.

The realignme=\nnt=20\nof the group into regional business units with joint trading, mid-marketing=\n,=20\nand origination operations has proven to be a catalyst for deal flow,=20\nproducing both a high volume of transactions and high value.  More=20\ntransactions were executed in January than any month last year, including o=\nne=20\ndeal that will bring tremendous strategic value to Enron as well.\n\nExecuted in January, was the purchase of two 35 MW coal-fired cogeneration=\n=20\nfacilities located in southeastern North Carolina.  ENA will supply steam t=\no=20\nthe industrial host, Alamac Knit Fabrics, and will sell power into the=20\nmerchant market.  The plants are inside Carolina Power & Light's service=20\nterritory, which is connected to AEP, Virginia Power, Duke, SCEG and SCPSA.=\n =20\nThese plants are the first purely merchant facilities in North Carolina. =\n=20\nThis deal exemplifies how Enron leverages its talent in that originators fr=\nom=20\nthe East Power Group and Industrial Markets Group joined forces to bring th=\nis=20\ndeal to execution.  They also leveraged the Global Markets group to manage=\n=20\nthe coal supply and emissions issues.\n\nProspects going forward look promising as a number of high value transactio=\nns=20\nare in the pipeline.  Of particular note is The Sandhill Power Project, a 1=\n80=20\nMW peaking facility currently under construction in Austin.  The facility i=\ns=20\nscheduled to come online in June, in time for the advent of deregulation in=\n=20\nTexas. The joint venture, between EPMI and Austin Energy, will provide both=\n=20\ntrading groups with a highly flexible asset, enabling them to access=20\nreal-time volatility while hedging existing obligations.\n\nAdditionally, the Fort Pierce (Florida) City Council voted 5 to 0 in favor =\nof=20\nEnron's proposal to repower the Ft. Pierce Utilities Authority's (FPUA)=20\nexisting power plant in that city.  Our proposed 180 MW facility will be us=\ned=20\nto produce steam to power the H.D. King facility at approximately 20 percen=\nt=20\nless cost than FPUA can produce it.  According to FPUA officials, this=20\nreduction in cost may lead to reduced rates for their ratepayers.

Gov. Gray Davis (D.) vetoed an identical bill (AB 1825)\nsponsored by Strom-Martin last year, stating that the legislation had\nthe \"potential to hurt all high-cost areas of the state.\"  Davis added\nthat he was concerned the plan could raise telephone service rates for\nother rural ratepayers.  (10/3/00 a.m.)\n\nStrom-Martin's staff told TR they are working with the Public Utilities\nCommission to make the bill more \"palatable\" to the governor.  Under AB\n140, the funding for the infrastructure grant program would come from\nthe California High-Cost Fund-A Administrative Committee Fund, the\nHigh-Cost Fund-B Administrative Committee Fund, or both.\n\nAccording to the staff, Davis' understanding of AB 1825 was incorrect\nand explained that all the needs satisfied by both high-cost funds would\nbe met before the infrastructure grant program would receive funds.  The\nstaff added that the grant fund wouldn't deplete either high-cost fund.\n\nThe staff said they were considering turning the grant program into a\nmore confined pilot fund.\n\nFUTURE OF REGULATION\nTEXAS\nConsumers Union offers recommendations for the Legislature\n\nConsumers Union, Southwest Region Office, has drafted several issue\nrecommendations for the Texas Legislature regarding telecom deregulation\nand electronic transactions.  In its report to the Legislature,\nConsumers Union concluded that five years after the federal\nTelecommunications Act of 1996 and six years after passage of Texas' law\npromoting telecom competition, few companies have emerged as true\ncompetitors to the incumbents.\n\nConsumers Union said the Public Utility Commission's report on\ncompetition came to similar conclusions.  The group, however, disagreed\nwith the PUC's recommendations.

Gov. Gray Davis (D.) vetoed an identical bill (AB 1825)\nsponsored by Strom-Martin last year, stating that the legislation had\nthe \"potential to hurt all high-cost areas of the state.\"  Davis added\nthat he was concerned the plan could raise telephone service rates for\nother rural ratepayers.  (10/3/00 a.m.)\n\nStrom-Martin's staff told TR they are working with the Public Utilities\nCommission to make the bill more \"palatable\" to the governor.  Under AB\n140, the funding for the infrastructure grant program would come from\nthe California High-Cost Fund-A Administrative Committee Fund, the\nHigh-Cost Fund-B Administrative Committee Fund, or both.\n\nAccording to the staff, Davis' understanding of AB 1825 was incorrect\nand explained that all the needs satisfied by both high-cost funds would\nbe met before the infrastructure grant program would receive funds.  The\nstaff added that the grant fund wouldn't deplete either high-cost fund.\n\nThe staff said they were considering turning the grant program into a\nmore confined pilot fund.\n\nFUTURE OF REGULATION\nTEXAS\nConsumers Union offers recommendations for the Legislature\n\nConsumers Union, Southwest Region Office, has drafted several issue\nrecommendations for the Texas Legislature regarding telecom deregulation\nand electronic transactions.  In its report to the Legislature,\nConsumers Union concluded that five years after the federal\nTelecommunications Act of 1996 and six years after passage of Texas' law\npromoting telecom competition, few companies have emerged as true\ncompetitors to the incumbents.\n\nConsumers Union said the Public Utility Commission's report on\ncompetition came to similar conclusions.  The group, however, disagreed\nwith the PUC's recommendations.  According to Consumers Union, several\nof the PUC's recommendations favored competitors over consumers.\n(1/12/01 p.m.)\n\nFor example, Consumers Union disagreed with the PUC's suggestion to lift\nthe current price cap and raise local phone rates.

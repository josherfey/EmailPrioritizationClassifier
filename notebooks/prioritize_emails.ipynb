    "# Prioritize Email Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to demonstrate a basic model to prioritize emails into three buckets: slow, default, priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outcome\n",
    "- Built a logistic regression model to predict email prioritization. \n",
    "- This model performance very well on synthetic data (n=500) with near perfect accuracy, indicating that synthetic data may be too cookie cutter and may not reflect real world varition.\n",
    "- Model was applied on two real world unlabeld email datasets (Resend spam example) and Enron dataset with visualization below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasets\n",
    "Thee datasets were used:\n",
    "- synthetic labeled dat\n",
    "  - used to train / evaluate model performance. \n",
    "  - Generated using the scripts in utils folder and used to catch several use cases: promotional emails, mfa verfication, time sensitive emails, and non urget emails.\n",
    "- unlabeled spam detection data \n",
    "  - provided by Resend\n",
    "- unlabled enron email data\n",
    "  -  More details [here](https://technocrat.github.io/_book/the-enron-email-corpus.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model training\n",
    "Model was trained using the synthetic data. Even though there were 10k emails in dataset, only 5k were used to train the model to avoid over training and since synthetic data was pretty simple. Even with limited training data, model performance was greater than 99% accuracy, indicating that synthetic data likely doesn't generalize well to real world. This considered, it will give a good baseline to improve upon as more real data comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model evaluation\n",
    "Three models were considered: logistic regression, random forest, and catboost. Given the simple nature of training data, logistic regression performed well enough and was chosen for its simplicity. We can evaluate later to swicth to more complex model as we get more features and labeled real world data\n",

It is intended only to cover the situation where Clickpaper \npersonnel use the password or otherwise access the website, in an \nunauthorized manner, on behalf of a counterparty.  The language does not \naddress the hacker situation as we place the burden in that situation upon \nthe counterparty.\n\nFinally, since the Password App. is a legal, electronic agreement, any \namendments or modifications for a counterparty must come through my office or \nthrough Tana Jones ((x. 33399).  Accordingly, those counterparties who have \nraised the issue should call either one of us if further action is \nnecessary.  We do not actually revise the form agreements, but do provide \nside letters indicating modifications to the form agreement.\n\nOnce again, please accept my apologizes for the delay.  Let me know if you \nshould need anything further.\n\n << File: passwordlanguage(2-01).doc >> \n\nMark\nSenior Counsel, ENA\nPhone:     713-345-8897\nFacsimile: 713-646-3940\nE-Mail:      Mark.Greenberg@enron.com\n"

Since Gov. Bar R.

Because of nature of  hearing=\n, commission did not exercise  quasi-judicial authority in denying  carryov=\ner, and prohibition is denied.  State ex rel. Potts v. Comm. on Continuing =\nLegal Edn.   93 Ohio St.3d 452     Attorneys-Discipline-Multiple Violations=\n-Suspension  Attorney is indefinitely suspended  where she accepted retaine=\nr but failed  to act on domestic relations matter,  delayed repayment, and =\nfailed to  cooperate in investigation.  Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Demore-Ford =\n  93 Ohio St.3d 417     Criminal Law-Association-Intrastate Travel  Defenda=\nnt was convicted of drug offense  and subsequently of trespass in a drug  e=\nxclusion zone. Although ordinance is  justified by a compelling state  inte=\nrest in allowing public use and  enjoyment within zones free from  illegal =\ndrug abuse, it infringes on the  fundamental right of freedom of  intrastat=\ne travel and violates the Due  Process Clause of the Fourteenth  Amendment.=\n Because exclusion of  defendant from drug exclusion zone was  imposed by t=\nhe executive branch, it  added a criminal penalty for his drug  offense nei=\nther imposed by a court nor  authorized by state criminal statute,  in viol=\nation of Ohio Const., Art.  XVIII, ?3. Also discussed: ordinance  prohibiti=\nng access only, not human  relationships or associations;  Supremacy Clause=\n.  State v. Burnett   93 Ohio St.3d 419     Criminal Law-Habeas Corpus-Paro=\nle Hearing-Guidelines-Due Process  Defendant was sentenced for involuntary =\n manslaughter and aggravated burglary  and was denied parole, with his next=\n  hearing scheduled to be held in 10  years. Court of appeals did not err i=\nn  dismissing petition for habeas corpus.  Adult parole authority's alleged=\n  failure to follow its guidelines does  not entitle defendant to release; =\nhe  has no due process right to have  alleged errors expunged from parole  =\ndetermination records; his parole was  never revoked so as to trigger due  =\nprocess hearing rights; and his  petition was defective because he did  not=\n attach all pertinent commitment  papers, ORC ?2725.04(D).  State ex rel. B=\nray v. Brigano   93 Ohio St.3d 458     Criminal Law-Habeas Corpus-Release-G=\nood Time Credit  Defendant was convicted of felonious  assault and filed ha=\nbeas corpus  petition for release on grounds that  his accumulated \"good ti=\nme\" credits  under ORC ?2967.193 and former ORC  ?2967.19 entitled him to r=\nelease. Court  of appeals did not err in dismissing  petition since statuto=\nry provisions do  not reduce the maximum term of his  indeterminate sentenc=\ne and do not  entitle him to release before serving  the maximum.  Hanes v.=\n Haviland   93 Ohio St.3d 465     Practice and Procedure-Final Order-Attorn=\ney-Admission Pro Hac Vice  Judgment of court of appeals reversed  on author=\nity of ORC ?2505.02 and  Guccione v.

Streicher   93 Ohio St.3d 446     Practice and Proced=\nure-Judgment-Notice   In a foreclosure action, trial court  denied defendan=\nt's Civ. R. 60(B) and  other pending motions, and defendant  appealed. Writ=\n of prohibition is  granted where court of appeals erred in  denying plaint=\niff's motion to dismiss  appeal as untimely since bailiff mailed  notice to=\n parties' last known address  within three days of entry of judgment,  whic=\nh complied with Civ. R. 58(B), and  appeal should have been filed within 30=\n  days, App.R. 4(A).  State ex rel. Pheils v. Pietrykowski   93 Ohio St.3d =\n460     Public Records-Community General Hospital Association-ORC ?149.011(=\nA)  In original mandamus action by  taxpayers and residents under ORC  ?149=\n.43 to inspect, inter  alia, minutes of board of trustees  of community gen=\neral hospital  association, writ is denied.  Association was not subject to=\n Public  Records Act because it was not a  \"public office\" or a \"public  in=\nstitution\" under ORC ?149.011(A). The  municipalities had no control over  =\nhospital's operation and no board  member acted in representational  capaci=\nty for them, and provision of  hospital care is not a uniquely  governmenta=\nl service. The initial  issuance of bonds by municipalities for  hospital's=\n construction, without  provision of funds for other equipment  or operatio=\nns, coupled with lease of  building at arguably less than fair  market rate=\n, does not constitute  support by public taxation.  State ex rel. Stys v. P=\narma Community Gen. Hosp.   93 Ohio St.3d 438     Schools-Administrator-Ter=\nmination-Notice-Mandamus-Appeal-Moot  Relator did not receive written notic=\ne  from school board of termination of his  employment as an administrative=\n officer  as required by ORC ?3319.02(C), and  court of appeals granted man=\ndamus to  compel school board to issue an \"other  administrator's\" employme=\nnt contract  and to pay him back pay and benefits,  but denied attorney fee=\ns. Since board  awarded relator the extraordinary  relief ordered by court =\nof appeals,  board's appeal is dismissed as moot.  Also discussed: attorney=\n fees as  damages under ORC ?2731.11.  State ex rel. Chapnick v. E. Clevela=\nnd City School Dist. Bd. of Edn.   93 Ohio St.3d 449     Workers' Compensat=\nion-Average Weekly Wage  Claim for industrial injury in 1976 was  allowed, =\nand in 1996 claimant moved  Industrial Commission to reset her  allowed ave=\nrage weekly wage, which was  denied. Court of appeals did not err in  grant=\ning writ of mandamus limited to  consideration of readjustment for two  yea=\nrs preceding the motion.  State ex rel. Lunsford v. Indus. Comm.   93 Ohio =\nSt.3d 448   Court of Appeals Opinions     Children-Custody-Modification-Bes=\nt Interests-Alcoholism  After custody of minor children and  residential pa=\nrent status were granted  father in divorce action, trial court  did not er=\nr in modifying custody to  mother who was moving out of Ohio and  granting =\nvisitation rights to father.  There was some competent evidence to  support=\n trial court's determination  under ORC ?3109.04(F)(1), where father,  an a=\ndmitted alcoholic, was involved in  several drinking incidents, one in  fro=\nnt of the children, he had not seen  an alcoholism counselor in six months,=\n  and the children were tardy to or  absent from school many times.  Sallee=\n v. Sallee (12th Dist.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 366     Criminal Law-Plea Wit=\nhdrawal-Right to Counsel  Defendant, without counsel, entered no  contest p=\nlea to driving without a  license and was sentenced to a jail  term and fin=\ne, and he moved two days  later to withdraw his plea. Trial court  erred in=\n denying motion because the  state failed to meet its burden in  proving th=\nat right to counsel was  properly waived under criminal rules  where there =\nwas only mere written  waiver of right to counsel. Also  discussed: stateme=\nnt of facts and  issues in absence of opposing brief.  State v. Caynor (7th=\n Dist.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 424     Criminal Law-Search and Seizure-Sobri=\nety Checkpoint  Defendant was indicted for possession  of crack cocaine and=\n criminal tools  arising out of a stop and search after  he made a U-turn o=\nn approaching a  sobriety checkpoint. Trial court did  not err in granting =\nmotion to suppress  drugs and crack pipes where defendant  had not entered =\nfunnel of checkpoint  before executing legal U-turn into  driveway and offi=\ncer's view was not  optimal. Where defendant committed no  traffic violatio=\nn, police had  insufficient cause to stop him based  solely on his turning =\naround prior to  entering the checkpoint.     State v. Bryson (8th Dist.-20=\n01)  142 Ohio App.3d 397     Criminal Law-Sexual Classification-Sexual Pred=\nator-Evidence-Recidivism  In 1985, defendant was convicted of  felonious as=\nsault after being indicted  for kidnapping, rape, robbery and  felonious as=\nsault, each with an  aggravated felony specification of an  earlier attempt=\ned rape conviction.  Trial court did not err in classifying  defendant a se=\nxual predator 15 years  after his felonious assault conviction.  Under ORC =\n?2950.01(E), court properly  received into evidence victim's  statement and=\n testimony that  defendant's felonious assault was for  the purpose of grat=\nifying his sexual  needs and desires. Victim's statement  and testimony, de=\nfendant's lengthy  criminal record and prior convictions  and arrests, age =\nof victim and violent  nature of crime were probative of  defendant's likel=\nihood of recidivism.  State v. Childs (8th Dist.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 389=\n     Dentists-License Examination-Standing-Public Action Exception  Trial c=\nourt did not err in dismissing  for lack of standing dentists' mandamus  ac=\ntion against state dental board to  compel promulgation of administrative  =\nregulation designating acceptable  dental licensure examinations. Duty  sou=\nght to be compelled is not for the  benefit of the public sufficient to  su=\npply standing under the public action  exception to general standing rules,=\n  and dentist who was awarded judgment in  prior action remanding denial of=\n  licensure to board did not have  standing because his license  applicatio=\nn did not depend on alleged  invalidity of the rule adopted, OAC  ?4715-5-0=\n3, or the rule he sought to  compel by mandamus.  Bowers v. Ohio State Dent=\nal Bd. (10th Dist.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 376     Negligence-Medical Malpra=\nctice-Res Ipsa Loquitur-Jury Instructions-Jury Interrogatories  In medical =\nmalpractice action against  hospital, doctors and practice arising  out of =\npatient's death after heart  surgery from complications involving  alleged =\npuncture of trachea, jury  returned verdict for all defendants.  Trial cour=\nt did not err in not  instructing jury on breach of fiduciary  duty and bai=\nlment since no fiduciary  duty claim is necessary under medical  malpractic=\ne and patient is not bailed  property; in giving an interrogatory  that all=\nowed jury to find negligence  without determining the cause because  this d=\nid not nullify instruction on  res ipsa loquitur; and in  instructing jury =\non issue of res  ipsa loquitur where court  immediately corrected a slip of=\n the  tongue, and plaintiff failed to object  at trial.  Martin v. St. Vinc=\nent Med. Ctr. (6th Dist.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 347     Negligence-Slip and=\n Fall-Hazardous Condition-Expert Testimony  In negligence action for slip a=\nnd fall  in restaurant, jury returned verdict  for restaurant. Trial court =\ndid not  abuse its discretion in denying  mistrial where plaintiff did not =\nbear  her burden of proof that restaurant  created hazardous condition, and=\n any  error by trial court in failing to  conduct evidentiary analysis afte=\nr  defense counsel referred to plaintiff's  litigation history was harmless=\n; in  excluding testimony of plaintiff's  expert regarding slipperiness of =\ntile  floor where he did not visit scene or  perform tile experiments, and =\nhis  opinion was based on deductive  reasoning and the elimination of all  =\nother causes of the slip. Also  discussed: trial court's comments not  prej=\nudicial.  Eller v. Wendy's Internatl. (10th Dist.-2000)  142 Ohio App.3d 32=\n1     Nuisance-Municipal Corporations-Park Roadway-Recreational Use Immunit=\ny  In nuisance action against city by  bicyclist injured in fall after  str=\niking traffic control bump on  roadway in city park, trial court erred  in =\ngranting summary judgment to city on  basis of recreational use immunity.  =\nRoadway is available to general public  for travel by vehicles and bicycles=\n for  recreational and nonrecreational use.  ORC ?1533.181, which affords  =\nrecreational use immunity only, is  inapplicable.  Vinar v. Bexley (10th Di=\nst.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 341     Practice and Procedure-Notice Dismissals=\n-Double Dismissal Rule-Civ. R. 41(A)(1)  Employee was discharged allegedly =\nin  retaliation for disclosing safety  violations to Federal Aviation  Admi=\nnistration and filed and then  voluntarily dismissed federal court  False C=\nlaims Act complaint and separate  state court Whistleblower Act action,  an=\nd then commenced a third similar  action in state court. Trial court did  n=\not err in dismissing third action with  prejudice under Civ. R. 41(A)(1) do=\nuble  dismissal rule because the three  actions constituted the same claim =\n under Civ. R. 41(A)(1). The actions  arose out of employee's termination  =\nfollowing his report of safety  violations, even though the claims were  ba=\nsed on different theories of  recovery. Also discussed: dismissal of  Unite=\nd States in action that included  private claims; statutory ORC ?4113.52  a=\nnd public policy Whistleblower  claims.  Forshey v. Airborne Freight Corp. =\n(12th Dist.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 404     Torts-Defamation-Public Figure-L=\nimited-Purpose-Actual Malice  In defamation action by businessman  against =\nmagazine publisher and author  referring, inter alia, to his  federal indic=\ntment, trial court did not  err in granting summary judgment to  defendants=\n on grounds of plaintiff's  being a limited-purpose public figure  and lack=\n of actual malice and  fair-report privilege. Plaintiff is a  limited-purpo=\nse public figure to whom  the actual malice element of proof  applies becau=\nse over 100 newspaper  articles concerning him and his  business had been p=\nublished over a  14-year span. Also discussed: federal  indictment fell wit=\nhin fair-report  privilege.  Kassouf v.

Since Gov. Bar R.  X(3)(B)(2) entit=\nles attorney who  completes more than the required CLE in  a reporting peri=\nod to a maximum of 12  carryover credit hours, commission is  not authorize=\nd by Gov. Bar R. X or its  own regulations to deny such carryover  because =\nof attorney's failure to timely  file report. Because of nature of  hearing=\n, commission did not exercise  quasi-judicial authority in denying  carryov=\ner, and prohibition is denied.  State ex rel. Potts v. Comm. on Continuing =\nLegal Edn.   93 Ohio St.3d 452     Attorneys-Discipline-Multiple Violations=\n-Suspension  Attorney is indefinitely suspended  where she accepted retaine=\nr but failed  to act on domestic relations matter,  delayed repayment, and =\nfailed to  cooperate in investigation.  Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Demore-Ford =\n  93 Ohio St.3d 417     Criminal Law-Association-Intrastate Travel  Defenda=\nnt was convicted of drug offense  and subsequently of trespass in a drug  e=\nxclusion zone. Although ordinance is  justified by a compelling state  inte=\nrest in allowing public use and  enjoyment within zones free from  illegal =\ndrug abuse, it infringes on the  fundamental right of freedom of  intrastat=\ne travel and violates the Due  Process Clause of the Fourteenth  Amendment.=\n Because exclusion of  defendant from drug exclusion zone was  imposed by t=\nhe executive branch, it  added a criminal penalty for his drug  offense nei=\nther imposed by a court nor  authorized by state criminal statute,  in viol=\nation of Ohio Const., Art.  XVIII, ?3. Also discussed: ordinance  prohibiti=\nng access only, not human  relationships or associations;  Supremacy Clause=\n.  State v. Burnett   93 Ohio St.3d 419     Criminal Law-Habeas Corpus-Paro=\nle Hearing-Guidelines-Due Process  Defendant was sentenced for involuntary =\n manslaughter and aggravated burglary  and was denied parole, with his next=\n  hearing scheduled to be held in 10  years. Court of appeals did not err i=\nn  dismissing petition for habeas corpus.  Adult parole authority's alleged=\n  failure to follow its guidelines does  not entitle defendant to release; =\nhe  has no due process right to have  alleged errors expunged from parole  =\ndetermination records; his parole was  never revoked so as to trigger due  =\nprocess hearing rights; and his  petition was defective because he did  not=\n attach all pertinent commitment  papers, ORC ?2725.04(D).  State ex rel. B=\nray v. Brigano   93 Ohio St.3d 458     Criminal Law-Habeas Corpus-Release-G=\nood Time Credit  Defendant was convicted of felonious  assault and filed ha=\nbeas corpus  petition for release on grounds that  his accumulated \"good ti=\nme\" credits  under ORC ?2967.193 and former ORC  ?2967.19 entitled him to r=\nelease. Court  of appeals did not err in dismissing  petition since statuto=\nry provisions do  not reduce the maximum term of his  indeterminate sentenc=\ne and do not  entitle him to release before serving  the maximum.  Hanes v.=\n Haviland   93 Ohio St.3d 465     Practice and Procedure-Final Order-Attorn=\ney-Admission Pro Hac Vice  Judgment of court of appeals reversed  on author=\nity of ORC ?2505.02 and  Guccione v. Hustler Magazine,  Inc. (1985), 17 Ohi=\no St.3d 88.  Klein v. Streicher   93 Ohio St.3d 446     Practice and Proced=\nure-Judgment-Notice   In a foreclosure action, trial court  denied defendan=\nt's Civ. R. 60(B) and  other pending motions, and defendant  appealed. Writ=\n of prohibition is  granted where court of appeals erred in  denying plaint=\niff's motion to dismiss  appeal as untimely since bailiff mailed  notice to=\n parties' last known address  within three days of entry of judgment,  whic=\nh complied with Civ. R. 58(B), and  appeal should have been filed within 30=\n  days, App.R. 4(A).  State ex rel. Pheils v. Pietrykowski   93 Ohio St.3d =\n460     Public Records-Community General Hospital Association-ORC ?149.011(=\nA)  In original mandamus action by  taxpayers and residents under ORC  ?149=\n.43 to inspect, inter  alia, minutes of board of trustees  of community gen=\neral hospital  association, writ is denied.  Association was not subject to=\n Public  Records Act because it was not a  \"public office\" or a \"public  in=\nstitution\" under ORC ?149.011(A). The  municipalities had no control over  =\nhospital's operation and no board  member acted in representational  capaci=\nty for them, and provision of  hospital care is not a uniquely  governmenta=\nl service. The initial  issuance of bonds by municipalities for  hospital's=\n construction, without  provision of funds for other equipment  or operatio=\nns, coupled with lease of  building at arguably less than fair  market rate=\n, does not constitute  support by public taxation.  State ex rel. Stys v. P=\narma Community Gen. Hosp.   93 Ohio St.3d 438     Schools-Administrator-Ter=\nmination-Notice-Mandamus-Appeal-Moot  Relator did not receive written notic=\ne  from school board of termination of his  employment as an administrative=\n officer  as required by ORC ?3319.02(C), and  court of appeals granted man=\ndamus to  compel school board to issue an \"other  administrator's\" employme=\nnt contract  and to pay him back pay and benefits,  but denied attorney fee=\ns. Since board  awarded relator the extraordinary  relief ordered by court =\nof appeals,  board's appeal is dismissed as moot.  Also discussed: attorney=\n fees as  damages under ORC ?2731.11.  State ex rel. Chapnick v. E. Clevela=\nnd City School Dist. Bd. of Edn.   93 Ohio St.3d 449     Workers' Compensat=\nion-Average Weekly Wage  Claim for industrial injury in 1976 was  allowed, =\nand in 1996 claimant moved  Industrial Commission to reset her  allowed ave=\nrage weekly wage, which was  denied. Court of appeals did not err in  grant=\ning writ of mandamus limited to  consideration of readjustment for two  yea=\nrs preceding the motion.  State ex rel. Lunsford v. Indus. Comm.   93 Ohio =\nSt.3d 448   Court of Appeals Opinions     Children-Custody-Modification-Bes=\nt Interests-Alcoholism  After custody of minor children and  residential pa=\nrent status were granted  father in divorce action, trial court  did not er=\nr in modifying custody to  mother who was moving out of Ohio and  granting =\nvisitation rights to father.  There was some competent evidence to  support=\n trial court's determination  under ORC ?3109.04(F)(1), where father,  an a=\ndmitted alcoholic, was involved in  several drinking incidents, one in  fro=\nnt of the children, he had not seen  an alcoholism counselor in six months,=\n  and the children were tardy to or  absent from school many times.  Sallee=\n v. Sallee (12th Dist.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 366     Criminal Law-Plea Wit=\nhdrawal-Right to Counsel  Defendant, without counsel, entered no  contest p=\nlea to driving without a  license and was sentenced to a jail  term and fin=\ne, and he moved two days  later to withdraw his plea. Trial court  erred in=\n denying motion because the  state failed to meet its burden in  proving th=\nat right to counsel was  properly waived under criminal rules  where there =\nwas only mere written  waiver of right to counsel. Also  discussed: stateme=\nnt of facts and  issues in absence of opposing brief.  State v. Caynor (7th=\n Dist.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 424     Criminal Law-Search and Seizure-Sobri=\nety Checkpoint  Defendant was indicted for possession  of crack cocaine and=\n criminal tools  arising out of a stop and search after  he made a U-turn o=\nn approaching a  sobriety checkpoint. Trial court did  not err in granting =\nmotion to suppress  drugs and crack pipes where defendant  had not entered =\nfunnel of checkpoint  before executing legal U-turn into  driveway and offi=\ncer's view was not  optimal. Where defendant committed no  traffic violatio=\nn, police had  insufficient cause to stop him based  solely on his turning =\naround prior to  entering the checkpoint.     State v. Bryson (8th Dist.-20=\n01)  142 Ohio App.3d 397     Criminal Law-Sexual Classification-Sexual Pred=\nator-Evidence-Recidivism  In 1985, defendant was convicted of  felonious as=\nsault after being indicted  for kidnapping, rape, robbery and  felonious as=\nsault, each with an  aggravated felony specification of an  earlier attempt=\ned rape conviction.  Trial court did not err in classifying  defendant a se=\nxual predator 15 years  after his felonious assault conviction.  Under ORC =\n?2950.01(E), court properly  received into evidence victim's  statement and=\n testimony that  defendant's felonious assault was for  the purpose of grat=\nifying his sexual  needs and desires. Victim's statement  and testimony, de=\nfendant's lengthy  criminal record and prior convictions  and arrests, age =\nof victim and violent  nature of crime were probative of  defendant's likel=\nihood of recidivism.  State v. Childs (8th Dist.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 389=\n     Dentists-License Examination-Standing-Public Action Exception  Trial c=\nourt did not err in dismissing  for lack of standing dentists' mandamus  ac=\ntion against state dental board to  compel promulgation of administrative  =\nregulation designating acceptable  dental licensure examinations. Duty  sou=\nght to be compelled is not for the  benefit of the public sufficient to  su=\npply standing under the public action  exception to general standing rules,=\n  and dentist who was awarded judgment in  prior action remanding denial of=\n  licensure to board did not have  standing because his license  applicatio=\nn did not depend on alleged  invalidity of the rule adopted, OAC  ?4715-5-0=\n3, or the rule he sought to  compel by mandamus.  Bowers v. Ohio State Dent=\nal Bd. (10th Dist.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 376     Negligence-Medical Malpra=\nctice-Res Ipsa Loquitur-Jury Instructions-Jury Interrogatories  In medical =\nmalpractice action against  hospital, doctors and practice arising  out of =\npatient's death after heart  surgery from complications involving  alleged =\npuncture of trachea, jury  returned verdict for all defendants.  Trial cour=\nt did not err in not  instructing jury on breach of fiduciary  duty and bai=\nlment since no fiduciary  duty claim is necessary under medical  malpractic=\ne and patient is not bailed  property; in giving an interrogatory  that all=\nowed jury to find negligence  without determining the cause because  this d=\nid not nullify instruction on  res ipsa loquitur; and in  instructing jury =\non issue of res  ipsa loquitur where court  immediately corrected a slip of=\n the  tongue, and plaintiff failed to object  at trial.  Martin v. St. Vinc=\nent Med. Ctr. (6th Dist.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 347     Negligence-Slip and=\n Fall-Hazardous Condition-Expert Testimony  In negligence action for slip a=\nnd fall  in restaurant, jury returned verdict  for restaurant. Trial court =\ndid not  abuse its discretion in denying  mistrial where plaintiff did not =\nbear  her burden of proof that restaurant  created hazardous condition, and=\n any  error by trial court in failing to  conduct evidentiary analysis afte=\nr  defense counsel referred to plaintiff's  litigation history was harmless=\n; in  excluding testimony of plaintiff's  expert regarding slipperiness of =\ntile  floor where he did not visit scene or  perform tile experiments, and =\nhis  opinion was based on deductive  reasoning and the elimination of all  =\nother causes of the slip. Also  discussed: trial court's comments not  prej=\nudicial.  Eller v. Wendy's Internatl. (10th Dist.-2000)  142 Ohio App.3d 32=\n1     Nuisance-Municipal Corporations-Park Roadway-Recreational Use Immunit=\ny  In nuisance action against city by  bicyclist injured in fall after  str=\niking traffic control bump on  roadway in city park, trial court erred  in =\ngranting summary judgment to city on  basis of recreational use immunity.  =\nRoadway is available to general public  for travel by vehicles and bicycles=\n for  recreational and nonrecreational use.  ORC ?1533.181, which affords  =\nrecreational use immunity only, is  inapplicable.  Vinar v. Bexley (10th Di=\nst.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 341     Practice and Procedure-Notice Dismissals=\n-Double Dismissal Rule-Civ. R. 41(A)(1)  Employee was discharged allegedly =\nin  retaliation for disclosing safety  violations to Federal Aviation  Admi=\nnistration and filed and then  voluntarily dismissed federal court  False C=\nlaims Act complaint and separate  state court Whistleblower Act action,  an=\nd then commenced a third similar  action in state court. Trial court did  n=\not err in dismissing third action with  prejudice under Civ. R. 41(A)(1) do=\nuble  dismissal rule because the three  actions constituted the same claim =\n under Civ. R. 41(A)(1). The actions  arose out of employee's termination  =\nfollowing his report of safety  violations, even though the claims were  ba=\nsed on different theories of  recovery. Also discussed: dismissal of  Unite=\nd States in action that included  private claims; statutory ORC ?4113.52  a=\nnd public policy Whistleblower  claims.  Forshey v. Airborne Freight Corp. =\n(12th Dist.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 404     Torts-Defamation-Public Figure-L=\nimited-Purpose-Actual Malice  In defamation action by businessman  against =\nmagazine publisher and author  referring, inter alia, to his  federal indic=\ntment, trial court did not  err in granting summary judgment to  defendants=\n on grounds of plaintiff's  being a limited-purpose public figure  and lack=\n of actual malice and  fair-report privilege. Plaintiff is a  limited-purpo=\nse public figure to whom  the actual malice element of proof  applies becau=\nse over 100 newspaper  articles concerning him and his  business had been p=\nublished over a  14-year span. Also discussed: federal  indictment fell wit=\nhin fair-report  privilege.  Kassouf v. Cleveland Magazine City Magazines (=\n11th Dist.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 413     Torts-Evidence-Spoliation-Bailmen=\nt  Employee was injured while driving  vehicle owned by his employer and  b=\nrought action for spoliation of  evidence and on bailment theory against  i=\nnsurer based on its sale of vehicle  for salvage. Trial court did not err i=\nn  granting summary judgment to insurer  since sale was not \"willful\"  dest=\nruction of evidence where there was  dialogue between plaintiff's attorney =\n and insurer's representative concerning  the status of the vehicle. There =\nwas no  bailment where employee did not  transfer a possessory interest in =\nthe  vehicle to the insurer because insurer  had already purchased it from =\nemployer.  Also discussed: negligent spoliation of  evidence.    White v. F=\nord Motor Co. (10th Dist.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 384   Misc Court     Pract=\nice and Procedure-Venue-Contracts-Place of Breach  In action by employee fo=\nr breach of  commissions contract against employer,  evidence showed that d=\necision not to  pay was made in county of employer's  principal place of bu=\nsiness, and  employer's motion is granted to  transfer venue to that county=\n from  county in which employer merely  maintained sales office.

Simultaneously, we will begin working with ENSR (if the open season \nreflects that we have a project) on developing a full scoped Environmental \nStrategy for Sun Devil (this will include an RFP that will immediately go out \nsoliciting bids for the Resource Reports and permits). \n3. We will work with Steve Veatch and Joe Hartso to schedule a meeting with \nthe FERC Staff (we need the commitment of the State Land Managing Agencies, \nUS Forest Service, etc. to collaborate with the FERC on the NEPA review) to \nintroduce the project and solicit their commitment to offer staff resources \nearly in the process.\n4. We will also need to develop a Public Relations and Government Affairs \nstrategy which will identify the early meetings that need to be held with \nlocal, state, federal jurisdictional governing bodies and politicians - so \nthe right folks have a heads-up on the project before it hits the news \nmedia.

Here is my attempt to type out a response.  I hope it \nhelps.\n\n1.  It was a matrix organization.  The IT personnel reported into the Global \nTech. group but we did that for communication and consistency  purposes \nrather than simply control.  They attended business unit staff meetings and \nthe BU had a great influence in the review process and gave constant \nfeedback.  It was vitally important for the \"customer\" to be happy and that \nthe IT person completed the projects from the BU.  When it came to the review \nprocess itself, GT ranked all the employees and peers but the business unit \nhad the greatest influence on where the person actually ranked and was rated.\n\n2.  When Enron Net Works was formed, nothing really changed on the day to day \nworking of the IT world.  IT (Global Technology) was folded into the newly \ncreated 5th business unit at Enron.  Remember Global Technology had more that \nIT alone.  We had an eCommerce commercial group, a principal investments \ngroup and was developing eCommerce or Technology origination roles developing \naround the world.\n\nPhilippe Bibi is the CTO for Enron and Enron Net Works.  He is in the office \nof the chairman of ENW with Greg Whalley, CEO and Louise Kitchen, the newly \nappointed COO.  Both LK and GW are non IT people.  There are many VPs on the \nnext level that are IT executives.\n\n3.  In a nut shell, Scott grinned when I told him of my 2 weeks experience \nand title as CEO with Enron's goal of becoming the largest B2B player in the \nworld.  He chuckled and said something like, \"That sounds like Enron, it \nalways looks at things differently.  He then stated that my CEO title and \nEnron's approach was very unusual but that it would be more common place \nsoon,  as this was the way of the future and Enron was the first to recognize \nit and change its culture\".\n\n4.  When i used the word cannibalize, I meant that if we didn't change the \nbusiness ourselves, than our competition would do this for us.  For example, \nwe were the leading trader of natural gas in the US by far but we initiated \nEnronOnline and completely changed the way we traded natural gas and did it \nfor free.  Thus we cannibalized our own successful business even when it was \ngoing great.  We are looking at all of our businesses for changes like that.\n\nGary, I hoped that helped.

Two \nof\nthe three top managers in Net Works are non-IT (from trading), correct?

I had a\nvery pleasant time there, and I found the meetings very\ninformative.\n\nAs discussed during my visit at Enron, I am sending you below\na DRAFT of the letter that would be needed to get the program\nin place and rolling, and start the students working on it.\nIt took a while to find out what the appropriate process was\nand how the letter should be structured. Sorry for the delay.\n\nIf I may, I'd like to visit Enron again, sometime in August,\nto define the research agenda more precisely and prioritize\nthe problems to look at. I'm in frequent contact with Giuseppe,\nwho is impressed by the environment there. We are trying to formulate\nthe research issues and problems to study, that would be of interest\nto Enron.  The plan is this:\n\n1) By August, Giuseppe will have been there for almost 2 months\nand will probably have a relatively good understanding of the Enron problem\nspace.\n\n2) I will work together with Giuseppe till August to formulate a set of\ngood problems of:\na) high practical importance\nb) high innovation potential\nc) serious scope.\n\n3) I could  visit in August (say mid-August or so) to:\na) discuss these problems with you and get your feedback\nb) prioritize the problems and evaluate their impact\nc) make sure we're on the same page regarding research strategy\nand execution path.\n\nI hope we can fully set up the program at Stanford before then, so\nthat I can bring on board one more Ph.D. student to start his\ndoctoral work in this area.\n\nI'm all excited about our collaboration. I am even thinking of\nstarting a research seminar at Stanford, specifically on these\nresearch issues!\n\nTalk to you soon.\nBest Regards,\n\nNick\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nDRAFT of letter to be sent from Enron to Stanford.\n\n\nProf. Nicholas Bambos\n420 Terman Engineering Center\nManagement Science & Eng.

         "Dasovich, Jeff (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nFYI.\n\nNevada PUC Acts To Change Or Void Long-Term Pwr Contracts \nLOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The Nevada Public Utilities Commission Wednesday voted to allow its General Counsel Office to take any action necessary to try to void or renegotiate long-term electricity contracts entered into by the state's two largest utilities, a PUC spokeswoman said. \nThe contracts would force Sierra Pacific Resources' (SRP) utilities Sierra Pacific Power Co. and Nevada Power Co. to pay a higher price for power than current market rates, said Don Soderberg, PUC chairman. \n\"We paid high prices when the prices were high, but to pay high prices when the prices are low is outrageous,\" Soderberg said. \nNo one at Sierra Pacific or Nevada Power was available to comment on which companies have signed contracts with the utilities, or the value of the contracts. \nThe PUC action follows a letter sent by Gov. Kenny Guinn to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in early October asking that the utilities be allowed to renegotiate the contracts. \nThe General Counsel's office will now have authority to file with FERC and in court to plead against the current contracts. \nSierra Pacific has said that a June FERC order that capped wholesale power prices has penalized the company. Sierra Pacific signed its forward contracts to escape high spot market prices, only to have those contracts end up being more expensive than the capped spot market prices, the company has said. As well, if the company wants to sell any surplus power into the spot market, it will now receive less for that power under the cap, it has said. \nCalifornia 's Public Utilities Commission is also pushing for renegotiation of $43 billion in long-term contracts signed by the state, which has been buying power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities since January.

Even- if \nyou don't particularly like zoos.  Everything I read says that it will take \nat least half a day.  I say we hit that Friday morning through early \nafternoon.  Spend mid-afternoon near the hotel- beach area- suppose to be \nshopping, etc. near there.  Then go to the game.  When we get back that \nnight- we can walk on the beach!\n\nSaturday:\n\nVisit Balboa Park.  See the Botanical Gardens, in other musuems/gardens in \nthe area that look interesting.  If we aren't sick of seeing animals, there \nis suppose to be a wonderful Wild Animal Park that gives trolley or walking \ntours (the tours are only like an hour and a half).  After that- there is a \nferry you can take across the bay to the Coronado Island to see the Hotel del \nCoronado.  It is suppose to be a really neat place.  Then- you we can finish \nthe day in the Gaslamp Quarter downtown.  It is suppose to have a \"lively \nevening street scene\" and live music.\n\nWhat do you think?  Let me know- so I can look up times that all of these \nopen- if we are interested.\n\nShanna\n\n",

         "skean.nsf\n\nAttached below please find the cash flow/tariff increase study we discussed 2 \n1/2 weeks ago at the Sunday DPC strategy session.  The study assumes a \ndecrease in losses from 40% to 25% and an increase in collection efficiency \n83% to 92% from 2000-01 to 2006-07.  Further, it is assumed that only one \nblock of DPC operates until 2006-07.  \n\nTwo scenarios based on average realisation are illustrated:\n\n1. A realistic cash flow study and  accompanying tariffs.  Given the above \nassumptions and assuming there is no state subsidy in 2006-07, MSEB should \nhave a cash flow deficit of R34 Cr. in 2006-07 when Phase II comes on line \nfor sale to MSEB, given a reasonable annual tariff increase.  (See the tariff \nsheet in gray shaded area.)  The annual rate increases would be15% for LT and \nHT agriculture and LT public water works, a 10% increase for domestic, street \nlights and interstate sales, a 4% increase for LT industrial and powerloom, \nand 1% increase for LT commercial and HT industrial, public water works and \nrailways.\n\n2. The annual tariff increases needed for MSEB to break even with a 3% \nprofit, assuming industrial and commercial classes are held flat, are \ndetailed below.  (See the Tariff sheet in red.) \n \n Domestic          8%\n LT Public Water Works    35.60% \n LT Agriculture and Poultry   26% \n Street Light     10.8%\n HT Agricultural & Poultry    26.9%\n Mula Pravara Electric Coop Soc.  24.30% \n Interstate sales       6.5%\n\nIt is obvious that  even the more realistic scenario would require strong \nMSEB, state government and regulator resolve.\n\nIn a separate e:mail I will describe the cost of service study we have also \ndeveloped for MSEB.  \n---------------------- Forwarded by Jane Wilson/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on \n02/06/2001 11:08 AM ---------------------------\n\nHeidi Hellmann\n\n02/06/2001 09:43 PM\n\nTo: Jane Wilson/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\ncc: Ban Sharma/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT \n\nSubject: Latest Model/Summary\n\nJane,\n\nAttached is the latest summary (hard coded numbers, like I sent before) and \nthe latest cashflow model in case that is required for anything.\n\nJust to confirm all that has changed are the customer categories and the MU's \nin 1999-2000.\n\n\n",

I realize it has been a \nwhile since we first spoke about this point. \n\nI have reviewed the concern about hackers and Enron use of Passwords and the \nbest we can do is insert language into the Password App. similar to that \nappearing in the attached document (which is the same type of language used \nin the ETA's).  It is intended only to cover the situation where Clickpaper \npersonnel use the password or otherwise access the website, in an \nunauthorized manner, on behalf of a counterparty.  The language does not \naddress the hacker situation as we place the burden in that situation upon \nthe counterparty.\n\nFinally, since the Password App. is a legal, electronic agreement, any \namendments or modifications for a counterparty must come through my office or \nthrough Tana Jones ((x. 33399).  Accordingly, those counterparties who have \nraised the issue should call either one of us if further action is \nnecessary.

Since Gov. Bar R.  X(3)(B)(2) entit=\nles attorney who  completes more than the required CLE in  a reporting peri=\nod to a maximum of 12  carryover credit hours, commission is  not authorize=\nd by Gov. Bar R. X or its  own regulations to deny such carryover  because =\nof attorney's failure to timely  file report. Because of nature of  hearing=\n, commission did not exercise  quasi-judicial authority in denying  carryov=\ner, and prohibition is denied.  State ex rel. Potts v. Comm. on Continuing =\nLegal Edn.   93 Ohio St.3d 452     Attorneys-Discipline-Multiple Violations=\n-Suspension  Attorney is indefinitely suspended  where she accepted retaine=\nr but failed  to act on domestic relations matter,  delayed repayment, and =\nfailed to  cooperate in investigation.  Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Demore-Ford =\n  93 Ohio St.3d 417     Criminal Law-Association-Intrastate Travel  Defenda=\nnt was convicted of drug offense  and subsequently of trespass in a drug  e=\nxclusion zone. Although ordinance is  justified by a compelling state  inte=\nrest in allowing public use and  enjoyment within zones free from  illegal =\ndrug abuse, it infringes on the  fundamental right of freedom of  intrastat=\ne travel and violates the Due  Process Clause of the Fourteenth  Amendment.=\n Because exclusion of  defendant from drug exclusion zone was  imposed by t=\nhe executive branch, it  added a criminal penalty for his drug  offense nei=\nther imposed by a court nor  authorized by state criminal statute,  in viol=\nation of Ohio Const., Art.  XVIII, ?3. Also discussed: ordinance  prohibiti=\nng access only, not human  relationships or associations;  Supremacy Clause=\n.  State v. Burnett   93 Ohio St.3d 419     Criminal Law-Habeas Corpus-Paro=\nle Hearing-Guidelines-Due Process  Defendant was sentenced for involuntary =\n manslaughter and aggravated burglary  and was denied parole, with his next=\n  hearing scheduled to be held in 10  years. Court of appeals did not err i=\nn  dismissing petition for habeas corpus.  Adult parole authority's alleged=\n  failure to follow its guidelines does  not entitle defendant to release; =\nhe  has no due process right to have  alleged errors expunged from parole  =\ndetermination records; his parole was  never revoked so as to trigger due  =\nprocess hearing rights; and his  petition was defective because he did  not=\n attach all pertinent commitment  papers, ORC ?2725.04(D).  State ex rel. B=\nray v. Brigano   93 Ohio St.3d 458     Criminal Law-Habeas Corpus-Release-G=\nood Time Credit  Defendant was convicted of felonious  assault and filed ha=\nbeas corpus  petition for release on grounds that  his accumulated \"good ti=\nme\" credits  under ORC ?2967.193 and former ORC  ?2967.19 entitled him to r=\nelease. Court  of appeals did not err in dismissing  petition since statuto=\nry provisions do  not reduce the maximum term of his  indeterminate sentenc=\ne and do not  entitle him to release before serving  the maximum.  Hanes v.=\n Haviland   93 Ohio St.3d 465     Practice and Procedure-Final Order-Attorn=\ney-Admission Pro Hac Vice  Judgment of court of appeals reversed  on author=\nity of ORC ?2505.02 and  Guccione v. Hustler Magazine,  Inc. (1985), 17 Ohi=\no St.3d 88.  Klein v. Streicher   93 Ohio St.3d 446     Practice and Proced=\nure-Judgment-Notice   In a foreclosure action, trial court  denied defendan=\nt's Civ. R. 60(B) and  other pending motions, and defendant  appealed. Writ=\n of prohibition is  granted where court of appeals erred in  denying plaint=\niff's motion to dismiss  appeal as untimely since bailiff mailed  notice to=\n parties' last known address  within three days of entry of judgment,  whic=\nh complied with Civ. R. 58(B), and  appeal should have been filed within 30=\n  days, App.R. 4(A).  State ex rel. Pheils v. Pietrykowski   93 Ohio St.3d =\n460     Public Records-Community General Hospital Association-ORC ?149.011(=\nA)  In original mandamus action by  taxpayers and residents under ORC  ?149=\n.43 to inspect, inter  alia, minutes of board of trustees  of community gen=\neral hospital  association, writ is denied.  Association was not subject to=\n Public  Records Act because it was not a  \"public office\" or a \"public  in=\nstitution\" under ORC ?149.011(A). The  municipalities had no control over  =\nhospital's operation and no board  member acted in representational  capaci=\nty for them, and provision of  hospital care is not a uniquely  governmenta=\nl service. The initial  issuance of bonds by municipalities for  hospital's=\n construction, without  provision of funds for other equipment  or operatio=\nns, coupled with lease of  building at arguably less than fair  market rate=\n, does not constitute  support by public taxation.  State ex rel. Stys v. P=\narma Community Gen. Hosp.   93 Ohio St.3d 438     Schools-Administrator-Ter=\nmination-Notice-Mandamus-Appeal-Moot  Relator did not receive written notic=\ne  from school board of termination of his  employment as an administrative=\n officer  as required by ORC ?3319.02(C), and  court of appeals granted man=\ndamus to  compel school board to issue an \"other  administrator's\" employme=\nnt contract  and to pay him back pay and benefits,  but denied attorney fee=\ns. Since board  awarded relator the extraordinary  relief ordered by court =\nof appeals,  board's appeal is dismissed as moot.  Also discussed: attorney=\n fees as  damages under ORC ?2731.11.  State ex rel. Chapnick v. E. Clevela=\nnd City School Dist. Bd. of Edn.   93 Ohio St.3d 449     Workers' Compensat=\nion-Average Weekly Wage  Claim for industrial injury in 1976 was  allowed, =\nand in 1996 claimant moved  Industrial Commission to reset her  allowed ave=\nrage weekly wage, which was  denied. Court of appeals did not err in  grant=\ning writ of mandamus limited to  consideration of readjustment for two  yea=\nrs preceding the motion.  State ex rel. Lunsford v. Indus. Comm.   93 Ohio =\nSt.3d 448   Court of Appeals Opinions     Children-Custody-Modification-Bes=\nt Interests-Alcoholism  After custody of minor children and  residential pa=\nrent status were granted  father in divorce action, trial court  did not er=\nr in modifying custody to  mother who was moving out of Ohio and  granting =\nvisitation rights to father.  There was some competent evidence to  support=\n trial court's determination  under ORC ?3109.04(F)(1), where father,  an a=\ndmitted alcoholic, was involved in  several drinking incidents, one in  fro=\nnt of the children, he had not seen  an alcoholism counselor in six months,=\n  and the children were tardy to or  absent from school many times.  Sallee=\n v. Sallee (12th Dist.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 366     Criminal Law-Plea Wit=\nhdrawal-Right to Counsel  Defendant, without counsel, entered no  contest p=\nlea to driving without a  license and was sentenced to a jail  term and fin=\ne, and he moved two days  later to withdraw his plea. Trial court  erred in=\n denying motion because the  state failed to meet its burden in  proving th=\nat right to counsel was  properly waived under criminal rules  where there =\nwas only mere written  waiver of right to counsel. Also  discussed: stateme=\nnt of facts and  issues in absence of opposing brief.  State v. Caynor (7th=\n Dist.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 424     Criminal Law-Search and Seizure-Sobri=\nety Checkpoint  Defendant was indicted for possession  of crack cocaine and=\n criminal tools  arising out of a stop and search after  he made a U-turn o=\nn approaching a  sobriety checkpoint. Trial court did  not err in granting =\nmotion to suppress  drugs and crack pipes where defendant  had not entered =\nfunnel of checkpoint  before executing legal U-turn into  driveway and offi=\ncer's view was not  optimal. Where defendant committed no  traffic violatio=\nn, police had  insufficient cause to stop him based  solely on his turning =\naround prior to  entering the checkpoint.     State v. Bryson (8th Dist.-20=\n01)  142 Ohio App.3d 397     Criminal Law-Sexual Classification-Sexual Pred=\nator-Evidence-Recidivism  In 1985, defendant was convicted of  felonious as=\nsault after being indicted  for kidnapping, rape, robbery and  felonious as=\nsault, each with an  aggravated felony specification of an  earlier attempt=\ned rape conviction.  Trial court did not err in classifying  defendant a se=\nxual predator 15 years  after his felonious assault conviction.  Under ORC =\n?2950.01(E), court properly  received into evidence victim's  statement and=\n testimony that  defendant's felonious assault was for  the purpose of grat=\nifying his sexual  needs and desires. Victim's statement  and testimony, de=\nfendant's lengthy  criminal record and prior convictions  and arrests, age =\nof victim and violent  nature of crime were probative of  defendant's likel=\nihood of recidivism.  State v. Childs (8th Dist.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 389=\n     Dentists-License Examination-Standing-Public Action Exception  Trial c=\nourt did not err in dismissing  for lack of standing dentists' mandamus  ac=\ntion against state dental board to  compel promulgation of administrative  =\nregulation designating acceptable  dental licensure examinations. Duty  sou=\nght to be compelled is not for the  benefit of the public sufficient to  su=\npply standing under the public action  exception to general standing rules,=\n  and dentist who was awarded judgment in  prior action remanding denial of=\n  licensure to board did not have  standing because his license  applicatio=\nn did not depend on alleged  invalidity of the rule adopted, OAC  ?4715-5-0=\n3, or the rule he sought to  compel by mandamus.  Bowers v. Ohio State Dent=\nal Bd. (10th Dist.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 376     Negligence-Medical Malpra=\nctice-Res Ipsa Loquitur-Jury Instructions-Jury Interrogatories  In medical =\nmalpractice action against  hospital, doctors and practice arising  out of =\npatient's death after heart  surgery from complications involving  alleged =\npuncture of trachea, jury  returned verdict for all defendants.  Trial cour=\nt did not err in not  instructing jury on breach of fiduciary  duty and bai=\nlment since no fiduciary  duty claim is necessary under medical  malpractic=\ne and patient is not bailed  property; in giving an interrogatory  that all=\nowed jury to find negligence  without determining the cause because  this d=\nid not nullify instruction on  res ipsa loquitur; and in  instructing jury =\non issue of res  ipsa loquitur where court  immediately corrected a slip of=\n the  tongue, and plaintiff failed to object  at trial.  Martin v. St. Vinc=\nent Med. Ctr. (6th Dist.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 347     Negligence-Slip and=\n Fall-Hazardous Condition-Expert Testimony  In negligence action for slip a=\nnd fall  in restaurant, jury returned verdict  for restaurant. Trial court =\ndid not  abuse its discretion in denying  mistrial where plaintiff did not =\nbear  her burden of proof that restaurant  created hazardous condition, and=\n any  error by trial court in failing to  conduct evidentiary analysis afte=\nr  defense counsel referred to plaintiff's  litigation history was harmless=\n; in  excluding testimony of plaintiff's  expert regarding slipperiness of =\ntile  floor where he did not visit scene or  perform tile experiments, and =\nhis  opinion was based on deductive  reasoning and the elimination of all  =\nother causes of the slip. Also  discussed: trial court's comments not  prej=\nudicial.  Eller v. Wendy's Internatl. (10th Dist.-2000)  142 Ohio App.3d 32=\n1     Nuisance-Municipal Corporations-Park Roadway-Recreational Use Immunit=\ny  In nuisance action against city by  bicyclist injured in fall after  str=\niking traffic control bump on  roadway in city park, trial court erred  in =\ngranting summary judgment to city on  basis of recreational use immunity.  =\nRoadway is available to general public  for travel by vehicles and bicycles=\n for  recreational and nonrecreational use.  ORC ?1533.181, which affords  =\nrecreational use immunity only, is  inapplicable.  Vinar v. Bexley (10th Di=\nst.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 341     Practice and Procedure-Notice Dismissals=\n-Double Dismissal Rule-Civ. R. 41(A)(1)  Employee was discharged allegedly =\nin  retaliation for disclosing safety  violations to Federal Aviation  Admi=\nnistration and filed and then  voluntarily dismissed federal court  False C=\nlaims Act complaint and separate  state court Whistleblower Act action,  an=\nd then commenced a third similar  action in state court. Trial court did  n=\not err in dismissing third action with  prejudice under Civ. R. 41(A)(1) do=\nuble  dismissal rule because the three  actions constituted the same claim =\n under Civ. R. 41(A)(1). The actions  arose out of employee's termination  =\nfollowing his report of safety  violations, even though the claims were  ba=\nsed on different theories of  recovery. Also discussed: dismissal of  Unite=\nd States in action that included  private claims; statutory ORC ?4113.52  a=\nnd public policy Whistleblower  claims.  Forshey v.

Plaintiff is a  limited-purpo=\nse public figure to whom  the actual malice element of proof  applies becau=\nse over 100 newspaper  articles concerning him and his  business had been p=\nublished over a  14-year span.

Cleveland Magazine City Magazines (=\n11th Dist.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 413     Torts-Evidence-Spoliation-Bailmen=\nt  Employee was injured while driving  vehicle owned by his employer and  b=\nrought action for spoliation of  evidence and on bailment theory against  i=\nnsurer based on its sale of vehicle  for salvage. Trial court did not err i=\nn  granting summary judgment to insurer  since sale was not \"willful\"  dest=\nruction of evidence where there was  dialogue between plaintiff's attorney =\n and insurer's representative concerning  the status of the vehicle. There =\nwas no  bailment where employee did not  transfer a possessory interest in =\nthe  vehicle to the insurer because insurer  had already purchased it from =\nemployer.  Also discussed: negligent spoliation of  evidence.    White v. F=\nord Motor Co.

Don't forget to take your camera.  Pictures (slides) would be most \nhelpful as we work through the early planning stages for the greenfield \nportion.  As the primary route begins to solidify with alternates, we will \nneed to develop some preliminary maps.  It is my understanding that no maps \nof the route will be released with sign-off from the entire group of: Hyatt, \nTaylor, Veatch and Shafer.\n\nAfter we receive the \"fatal-flaw\" desk-top analysis from ENSR (Sept. 21 - \nalthough I hope to get it sooner), I would offer that several events should \nbe scheduled to expedite the project as follows:\n1. If the open season reflects that we have a project and Eric Gadd approves, \na couple of quick meetings will be held with strategic groups to discuss the \nproject potential (TNC, State Land Managing agencies, US Forest Service, \netc).  These strategic groups will be identified by the ENSR fatal-flaw \nanalysis.\n2. Simultaneously, we will begin working with ENSR (if the open season \nreflects that we have a project) on developing a full scoped Environmental \nStrategy for Sun Devil (this will include an RFP that will immediately go out \nsoliciting bids for the Resource Reports and permits). \n3. We will work with Steve Veatch and Joe Hartso to schedule a meeting with \nthe FERC Staff (we need the commitment of the State Land Managing Agencies, \nUS Forest Service, etc. to collaborate with the FERC on the NEPA review) to \nintroduce the project and solicit their commitment to offer staff resources \nearly in the process.\n4. We will also need to develop a Public Relations and Government Affairs \nstrategy which will identify the early meetings that need to be held with \nlocal, state, federal jurisdictional governing bodies and politicians - so \nthe right folks have a heads-up on the project before it hits the news \nmedia.  This also includes developing a strategy on where and when the \nproject will formally be announced (i.e., news conference in Phoenix or \nHouston, etc.).  A $580 Million project will be a big deal in the Phoenix \narea and for the Southwest.\n\nI know there is more, but this will help to keep some of the early events \ncoordinated.  John Shafer\n",

         "mmcconn.nsf\n\nGary,\n\nThanks for the email.  Here is my attempt to type out a response.  I hope it \nhelps.\n\n1.  It was a matrix organization.  The IT personnel reported into the Global \nTech. group but we did that for communication and consistency  purposes \nrather than simply control.  They attended business unit staff meetings and \nthe BU had a great influence in the review process and gave constant \nfeedback.  It was vitally important for the \"customer\" to be happy and that \nthe IT person completed the projects from the BU.  When it came to the review \nprocess itself, GT ranked all the employees and peers but the business unit \nhad the greatest influence on where the person actually ranked and was rated.\n\n2.  When Enron Net Works was formed, nothing really changed on the day to day \nworking of the IT world.  IT (Global Technology) was folded into the newly \ncreated 5th business unit at Enron.  Remember Global Technology had more that \nIT alone.  We had an eCommerce commercial group, a principal investments \ngroup and was developing eCommerce or Technology origination roles developing \naround the world.\n\nPhilippe Bibi is the CTO for Enron and Enron Net Works.  He is in the office \nof the chairman of ENW with Greg Whalley, CEO and Louise Kitchen, the newly \nappointed COO.  Both LK and GW are non IT people.  There are many VPs on the \nnext level that are IT executives.\n\n3.  In a nut shell, Scott grinned when I told him of my 2 weeks experience \nand title as CEO with Enron's goal of becoming the largest B2B player in the \nworld.  He chuckled and said something like, \"That sounds like Enron, it \nalways looks at things differently.  He then stated that my CEO title and \nEnron's approach was very unusual but that it would be more common place \nsoon,  as this was the way of the future and Enron was the first to recognize \nit and change its culture\".\n\n4.  When i used the word cannibalize, I meant that if we didn't change the \nbusiness ourselves, than our competition would do this for us.  For example, \nwe were the leading trader of natural gas in the US by far but we initiated \nEnronOnline and completely changed the way we traded natural gas and did it \nfor free.  Thus we cannibalized our own successful business even when it was \ngoing great.  We are looking at all of our businesses for changes like that.\n\nGary, I hoped that helped.  Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have \nany other questions.\n\nMike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Gary Anthes\" <Gary_Anthes@computerworld.com> on 10/06/2000 04:18:40 PM\nTo: Mike McConnell <mike.mcconnell@enron.com>\ncc:  \nSubject: Thanks and a few residual questions\n\n\n\n\nHello Mike,\n\nThanks for sending me those presentation slides. They are good background. And\nthanks so much for meeting with Julia and me this week. It was most \ninteresting\nand helpful. I'm confused on a couple of points, so would you mind answering a\nfew more questions?\n\n1. You said that after Enron created the Global Technology group, you \"seeded\npeople out into the business units, and the way we did that is we had those\npeople be totally accountable both to us and to the business unit head.\" So, \nat\nthat point it was a sort of matrix organization, with IT people dispersed\nthoughout the business units but at the same time accountable to a central IT\norganization for things such as standards, is that correct?\n\n2. Then, this spring when Net Works was formed, did those 1,500 IT people\nessentially leave the business units to join a more traditional IT \norganization?\nRoughly how many non-IT people, and of what types, are part of Net Works? Two \nof\nthe three top managers in Net Works are non-IT (from trading), correct? Does \nany\ngiven IT person now still live in a matrix world with responsibilities to IT \nand\nto a business unit?\n\n3. For some reason, my recorder messed up and I couldn't decipher what you \nsaid\nabout Scott McNealy's reaction to your background, etc. at the breakfast. \nCould\nyou repeat that?\n\n4. You said: \"We had to cannibalize our own businesses. So what I think you'll\nsee five years from now is that the IT world will look totally different.\" \nWhat\ndid you mean by \"cannibalize our own business\"?.\n\nThanks again.\n\nRegards,\nGary Anthes\n\nGary H.

Not having the \ntransaction documentation to review in connection with this clause, I have \nbracketed several portions of the clause to be filled in as dictated by such \ndocumentation.  Please call with any follow up.

The parties \nrecognize and intend that, for United States federal income tax purposes, any \npayment by [Enron Re] of the [Floating - this assumes that Enron Re is paying \nsuch amount] Amount will be treated as a payment pursuant to a guaranty by \n[Enron Re][of the obligations of Bob West Treasure, LLC to make payments \npursuant to Section ___ of the [underlying Financing Agreement between Bob \nWest Treasure and Royal Bank of Canada - this needs to be clarifed - is the \npayment related to the RBC loan or the insurance payment by EFR?  If it is \nthe RBC loan then this clause is appropriate but if, alternatively, it is the \nEFR insurance payment, then the reference needs to be changed accordingly.]]  \nThe parties agree that to the extent either of the parties is required to \nreport any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit relating to the \nTransaction for United States federal income tax purposes, such party shall \nreport such item consistent with the characterization set forth above and \nshall not take any position on any tax return or report relating to United \nStates federal income taxes which is inconsistent with such \ncharacterization.  The parties recognize that the manner in which they have \nagreed to characterize the Transaction for United States federal income tax \npurposes may be different from the manner in which the Transaction is \ncharacterized for non-United States federal income tax purposes and for \naccounting, regulatory or other purposes.  The provisions of this Section are \nnot intended to affect the manner in which the parties report the Transaction \nfor such other purposes, or the interpretation of the provisions of the \nConfirmation and the rights and obligations of the Parties arising hereunder, \nfor any purposes.\n\n\n",

         "RE: Business Practice #11",
         "I have to tell you more than you want to know to preface this response. \nThere are 5 hydro projects in the Mid-Columbia region. These 5 projects are owned and controlled by 3 control areas - Douglas County PUD, Chelan County PUD and Grant County PUD. Some of the generation from these 5 projects has been sold on a long-term basis to several participants. I'm not familiar with the term \"take away rights\", but every mwh generated at these 5 projects is either used for load in the 3 control areas or it is moved away to participant's control areas. The fact that some want to represent their share of generation as being part of a \"single bus\" and claiming it can be moved away without naming a transmission provider does not accurately represent the transfer of energy from one control area to another. Douglas, Chelan and Grant are the only control areas at the Mid-Columbia with other adjacent control areas.\n\nEach participant has transmission capability (either their own or purchased) to transfer their share of generation from one of our control areas to their own. These transmission paths serve one of two purposes. 1) dynamic schedules or fixed schedules to serve load or 2) transfers for sale or resale.\n\nThe \"single bus\" idea at the Mid-C will soon be correctly represented for 4 of the 5 projects. Chelan and Grant plan to combine their control area boundaries (for scheduling and tagging purposes only) and call it the Mid-C HUB. This HUB is registered as a TP with NERC as MHUB and will accomodate transfers of energy BETWEEN participants. All other transactions will require other transmission to move energy OUT OF the Mid-C HUB. Douglas County PUD is not part of the Mid-C HUB or MHUB.\n\n\n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: Hackney, Mark W(Z39911) [<mailto:Mark.Hackney@aps.com>] \nSent: Wednesday, October 03, 2001 3:04 PM \nTo: Interchange Scheduling & Accounting Subcommittee (ISAS) \nSubject: Business Practice #11 \n\n\n\"For transactions that occur at only one bus (i.e. no OASIS/GF transmission \ninvolved) use a willing TP on the second line with the same PSE as on the \nfirst line and the words \"Single Bus\" in the OASIS reservation field and \n\"7-F\" as the Product.\" \n\nIs this practice not being practiced?  I've seen/heard that at the MID \nColumbia folks selling energy to those who have take away rights at MID C \nare have their tags denied because the tag creators are not using a \"TP \nspecific transmission path or designation\".  It was agreed to use \"Single \nBus\" in these situations to avoid the implications of transmission service \nwhere no transmission service was necessary from the MID C. \n\nIf the sink control area is bringing the energy back to their system at that \npoint then the sink should have it indicated that it's not a single bus for \ntheir transmission portion, but may be \"GF\" or \"No reservation required\" \nfrom the bus to the system.  But in this circumstance then the path is not \nMIDC-MIDC but MIDC-SYS.  That's my take.  Others wish to pipe in? \n\nMark W.

Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Demore-Ford =\n  93 Ohio St.3d 417     Criminal Law-Association-Intrastate Travel  Defenda=\nnt was convicted of drug offense  and subsequently of trespass in a drug  e=\nxclusion zone. Although ordinance is  justified by a compelling state  inte=\nrest in allowing public use and  enjoyment within zones free from  illegal =\ndrug abuse, it infringes on the  fundamental right of freedom of  intrastat=\ne travel and violates the Due  Process Clause of the Fourteenth  Amendment.=\n Because exclusion of  defendant from drug exclusion zone was  imposed by t=\nhe executive branch, it  added a criminal penalty for his drug  offense nei=\nther imposed by a court nor  authorized by state criminal statute,  in viol=\nation of Ohio Const., Art.  XVIII, ?3. Also discussed: ordinance  prohibiti=\nng access only, not human  relationships or associations;  Supremacy Clause=\n.  State v.

Court of appeals did not err i=\nn  dismissing petition for habeas corpus.  Adult parole authority's alleged=\n  failure to follow its guidelines does  not entitle defendant to release; =\nhe  has no due process right to have  alleged errors expunged from parole  =\ndetermination records; his parole was  never revoked so as to trigger due  =\nprocess hearing rights; and his  petition was defective because he did  not=\n attach all pertinent commitment  papers, ORC ?2725.04(D).  State ex rel. B=\nray v.

Pietrykowski   93 Ohio St.3d =\n460     Public Records-Community General Hospital Association-ORC ?149.011(=\nA)  In original mandamus action by  taxpayers and residents under ORC  ?149=\n.43 to inspect, inter  alia, minutes of board of trustees  of community gen=\neral hospital  association, writ is denied.  Association was not subject to=\n Public  Records Act because it was not a  \"public office\" or a \"public  in=\nstitution\" under ORC ?149.011(A). The  municipalities had no control over  =\nhospital's operation and no board  member acted in representational  capaci=\nty for them, and provision of  hospital care is not a uniquely  governmenta=\nl service. The initial  issuance of bonds by municipalities for  hospital's=\n construction, without  provision of funds for other equipment  or operatio=\nns, coupled with lease of  building at arguably less than fair  market rate=\n, does not constitute  support by public taxation.  State ex rel. Stys v. P=\narma Community Gen.

Since board  awarded relator the extraordinary  relief ordered by court =\nof appeals,  board's appeal is dismissed as moot.  Also discussed: attorney=\n fees as  damages under ORC ?2731.11.  State ex rel. Chapnick v. E. Clevela=\nnd City School Dist. Bd. of Edn.   93 Ohio St.3d 449     Workers' Compensat=\nion-Average Weekly Wage  Claim for industrial injury in 1976 was  allowed, =\nand in 1996 claimant moved  Industrial Commission to reset her  allowed ave=\nrage weekly wage, which was  denied.

Comm.   93 Ohio =\nSt.3d 448   Court of Appeals Opinions     Children-Custody-Modification-Bes=\nt Interests-Alcoholism  After custody of minor children and  residential pa=\nrent status were granted  father in divorce action, trial court  did not er=\nr in modifying custody to  mother who was moving out of Ohio and  granting =\nvisitation rights to father.  There was some competent evidence to  support=\n trial court's determination  under ORC ?3109.04(F)(1), where father,  an a=\ndmitted alcoholic, was involved in  several drinking incidents, one in  fro=\nnt of the children, he had not seen  an alcoholism counselor in six months,=\n  and the children were tardy to or  absent from school many times.  Sallee=\n v. Sallee (12th Dist.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 366     Criminal Law-Plea Wit=\nhdrawal-Right to Counsel  Defendant, without counsel, entered no  contest p=\nlea to driving without a  license and was sentenced to a jail  term and fin=\ne, and he moved two days  later to withdraw his plea. Trial court  erred in=\n denying motion because the  state failed to meet its burden in  proving th=\nat right to counsel was  properly waived under criminal rules  where there =\nwas only mere written  waiver of right to counsel. Also  discussed: stateme=\nnt of facts and  issues in absence of opposing brief.  State v. Caynor (7th=\n Dist.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 424     Criminal Law-Search and Seizure-Sobri=\nety Checkpoint  Defendant was indicted for possession  of crack cocaine and=\n criminal tools  arising out of a stop and search after  he made a U-turn o=\nn approaching a  sobriety checkpoint. Trial court did  not err in granting =\nmotion to suppress  drugs and crack pipes where defendant  had not entered =\nfunnel of checkpoint  before executing legal U-turn into  driveway and offi=\ncer's view was not  optimal. Where defendant committed no  traffic violatio=\nn, police had  insufficient cause to stop him based  solely on his turning =\naround prior to  entering the checkpoint.     State v. Bryson (8th Dist.-20=\n01)  142 Ohio App.3d 397     Criminal Law-Sexual Classification-Sexual Pred=\nator-Evidence-Recidivism  In 1985, defendant was convicted of  felonious as=\nsault after being indicted  for kidnapping, rape, robbery and  felonious as=\nsault, each with an  aggravated felony specification of an  earlier attempt=\ned rape conviction.  Trial court did not err in classifying  defendant a se=\nxual predator 15 years  after his felonious assault conviction.  Under ORC =\n?2950.01(E), court properly  received into evidence victim's  statement and=\n testimony that  defendant's felonious assault was for  the purpose of grat=\nifying his sexual  needs and desires. Victim's statement  and testimony, de=\nfendant's lengthy  criminal record and prior convictions  and arrests, age =\nof victim and violent  nature of crime were probative of  defendant's likel=\nihood of recidivism.  State v. Childs (8th Dist.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 389=\n     Dentists-License Examination-Standing-Public Action Exception  Trial c=\nourt did not err in dismissing  for lack of standing dentists' mandamus  ac=\ntion against state dental board to  compel promulgation of administrative  =\nregulation designating acceptable  dental licensure examinations. Duty  sou=\nght to be compelled is not for the  benefit of the public sufficient to  su=\npply standing under the public action  exception to general standing rules,=\n  and dentist who was awarded judgment in  prior action remanding denial of=\n  licensure to board did not have  standing because his license  applicatio=\nn did not depend on alleged  invalidity of the rule adopted, OAC  ?4715-5-0=\n3, or the rule he sought to  compel by mandamus.  Bowers v. Ohio State Dent=\nal Bd.

Trial cour=\nt did not err in not  instructing jury on breach of fiduciary  duty and bai=\nlment since no fiduciary  duty claim is necessary under medical  malpractic=\ne and patient is not bailed  property; in giving an interrogatory  that all=\nowed jury to find negligence  without determining the cause because  this d=\nid not nullify instruction on  res ipsa loquitur; and in  instructing jury =\non issue of res  ipsa loquitur where court  immediately corrected a slip of=\n the  tongue, and plaintiff failed to object  at trial.  Martin v. St. Vinc=\nent Med. Ctr. (6th Dist.-2001)  142 Ohio App.3d 347     Negligence-Slip and=\n Fall-Hazardous Condition-Expert Testimony  In negligence action for slip a=\nnd fall  in restaurant, jury returned verdict  for restaurant. Trial court =\ndid not  abuse its discretion in denying  mistrial where plaintiff did not =\nbear  her burden of proof that restaurant  created hazardous condition, and=\n any  error by trial court in failing to  conduct evidentiary analysis afte=\nr  defense counsel referred to plaintiff's  litigation history was harmless=\n; in  excluding testimony of plaintiff's  expert regarding slipperiness of =\ntile  floor where he did not visit scene or  perform tile experiments, and =\nhis  opinion was based on deductive  reasoning and the elimination of all  =\nother causes of the slip. Also  discussed: trial court's comments not  prej=\nudicial.  Eller v. Wendy's Internatl. (10th Dist.-2000)  142 Ohio App.3d 32=\n1     Nuisance-Municipal Corporations-Park Roadway-Recreational Use Immunit=\ny  In nuisance action against city by  bicyclist injured in fall after  str=\niking traffic control bump on  roadway in city park, trial court erred  in =\ngranting summary judgment to city on  basis of recreational use immunity.  =\nRoadway is available to general public  for travel by vehicles and bicycles=\n for  recreational and nonrecreational use.  ORC ?1533.181, which affords  =\nrecreational use immunity only, is  inapplicable.  Vinar v.

Trial court did  n=\not err in dismissing third action with  prejudice under Civ. R. 41(A)(1) do=\nuble  dismissal rule because the three  actions constituted the same claim =\n under Civ. R. 41(A)(1). The actions  arose out of employee's termination  =\nfollowing his report of safety  violations, even though the claims were  ba=\nsed on different theories of  recovery. Also discussed: dismissal of  Unite=\nd States in action that included  private claims; statutory ORC ?4113.52  a=\nnd public policy Whistleblower  claims.  Forshey v.

Plaintiff is a  limited-purpo=\nse public figure to whom  the actual malice element of proof  applies becau=\nse over 100 newspaper  articles concerning him and his  business had been p=\nublished over a  14-year span.

Look for more details in your mailbox soon.\n---------------------------------\nSeptember 13, 2001\nVol. 3, No. 17\n\nWhat's It Worth To You?\n\nNowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.\n- Oscar Wilde\n\nCertainly too few consumers and policymakers understand the value of renewable energy products - products that avoid the acid rain, smog, global warming, and soot pollution caused by mainly coal-burning power plants. Perhaps with the removal of stranded cost charges from consumers' bills next year, the Duquesne Light service territory will be the first market where both price and value of renewable energy are understood and motivate large numbers of customers to buy (see case studies that follow).\n\nMoreover, a new study published in the August 24, 2001 edition of Science, by Mark Z. Jacobson and Gilbert M. Masters of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University, shows that the \"cost gap\" between coal power and the cheapest forms of renewable energy is narrowing sharply, down to about 0.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh). Most importantly, professors Jacobson and Masters document that the apparently slightly lower cost of coal generation is more illusion than reality, due to its real costs.\n\nWhen coal generation's environmental and health costs like damage to air, water and forests, as well as human illness and death, are included in the calculation, coal generation's real price jumps to about 5.5 cents to 8.3 cents per kWh. By comparison, the 4.0 cents to 5.0 cents cost of wind energy makes it a bargain. \n\n\"Wind energy is unequivocally less expensive than is coal energy,\" say Jacobson and Masters.\n\nHow Much Is That Kilowatt-Hour?\nIt's not surprising that few know the value of renewable energy products in electricity markets where many real pollution costs from burning fossil fuels are not included in the price of electricity and where many consumers still don't know the link between electricity generation and environmental and health damage. \n\nYet lack of knowledge goes beyond value in electricity markets. Consumer inexperience with these markets and the complex transition to competition make electricity an exception to the rule that people know the price of everything. \n\nEven sophisticated observers don't know the price of comparative products, regardless of the added environmental and public health costs. Price transparency is a bad joke, because stranded cost charges make understanding price as easy as getting a clear view on a smoggy day in Houston.\n\nIn those states that allow customers to choose a generation supplier, few consumers and policymakers know what their local utility charged for generation prior to competition, including what are now called stranded costs. Perhaps even fewer know how prices alone, not including the stranded cost charges, of today's competitive products compare to their utilities' unbundled generation rates charged prior to competition. Or how today's renewable energy prices compare to utilities' pre-competition generation rates. \n\nAnd how many know how today's price to compare or default rate compares to the pre-competition, monopoly generation rate (which includes stranded costs)? Confusion on these basic questions is widespread and distorts perception and policy. \n\nIt is vital for policymakers to know the answers in order to formulate wise policy (see for answers, \"It's All in the Numbers,\" E3, Vol. 3 No. 12). But even that's only the foundation of what is perhaps a much tougher question about electricity: \"What is it worth?\" \n\nAn important change that will affect the answer is on the horizon. Beginning in February, 2002, stranded cost charges will be eliminated from electric bills in the Pittsburgh area. These are payments made to Duquesne, primarily to cover its prior investments in uneconomic, nuclear generation, recovered from consumers through the Competitive Transition Charge (CTC).\n\nThe following examples of typical types of customer bills in the Duquesne Light territory illustrate comparative prices at pre-restructuring or present default rates, the new default rates that will take effect next year, and for various renewable energy products. \n\nThese examples will hopefully clear away some of the haze surrounding the true price of renewable products.\n\nResidential Customers\nA typical residential customer (rate RS) using 600 kWh per month has been paying Duquesne Light about $75 per month since rates were capped in 1996. Of this monthly $75 bill, about $48 is for total generation costs and the rest is for distribution services.\n\nIn turn, more than $20 of the $48 total generation cost reflects stranded cost charges. Since customer choice began, all 600 kWh residential customers - including those choosing a competitive supplier - have had to pay Duquesne the same $20 for stranded costs. If customers were not required to pay Duquesne for its stranded costs, this typical customer's total bill would be less than $55, a whopping 27 percent less than it is now.\n\nAs a result of stranded cost charges, customers choosing a competitive supplier can only avoid paying Duquesne about $28 of its $48 generation rate, where the $28 reflects the \"shopping credit\" or price to compare that has been available. So, only if a customer could buy 600 kWh per month for less than $28, including transmission, would s/he save money by switching to a competitive supplier. \n\nAs you can see, stranded cost charges and the weird economics and pricing they produce make it difficult to know the price of electricity, let alone the value of renewable generation. \n\nIf our typical residential consumer purchased renewable generation today for 6.0 cents/kWh, the consumer would pay $36 for generation - $12 per month less than the historic regulated generation rate of $48. At a rate of 7.0 cents/kWh, the same consumer would pay $42 for renewable generation, or $6 per month less. The price for renewable generation must be over 8.0 cents/kWh for the consumer to pay more for it than what residential consumers paid their regulated utility for mostly coal and nuclear power. \n\nThere are presently four competitive suppliers offering five renewable energy products in Duquesne's territory (three are Green-e certified), for prices ranging from 6.5 cents to 7.0 cents/kWh. Renewable generation today costs substantially less than coal and nuclear generation did prior to competition. Yet, the $20 stranded cost charge that a 600 kWh renewable energy residential customer must pay in the Duquesne service territory has concealed not just the value of renewable energy, but also its real price. \n\nUntil February, a customer buying renewable generation for 7.0 cents/kWh - or $6 less than the pre-competition rate - will still have a total bill, including CTCs and distribution charges, that is $12 more than their current bill. While many might find that $12 more per month for cleaner energy and its associated benefits is still reasonable, many more who are motivated by their wallets alone probably would not. But a great opportunity is about to open up for renewable products as CTCs in the Duquesne Light territory are about to be eliminated. \n\nWhile the Public Utility Commission still hasn't established what the new regulated rates will be, it appears that a typical 600 kWh per month customer who buys generation from Duquesne/Orion will receive a rate reduction of about 16 percent, saving about $12 per month. However, customers won't receive the full savings from the elimination of CTCs because a portion will cover the costs of Duquesne's integration into the PJM-West Independent System Operator.\n\nBut as soon as the stranded cost charges are removed, a typical residential consumer could buy renewable energy products and pay less than what s/he paid for electricity under default rates, and less than s/he paid in 1996. Both the price and value will then be motivating factors for buying renewable energy.\n\nWhen the CTC is removed, the residential customer using 600 kWh per month will soon be able to use the savings to buy wind energy to serve one-third of his/her load - for a total of $68, or a savings of $7 compared to today's default rate. Even if the customer were to buy all of his/her electricity from one of the new wind farms being built in southwestern Pennsylvania, the customer would pay less than $3 more per month than s/he is currently paying for default generation.\n\nIf the customer chooses a blended product with both renewable and non-renewable content for 6.0 cents/kWh, the monthly bill would be $5 less than what it is today. Even at a price of 7.0 cents/kWh, the monthly bill for a blended product would be less than $1 per month more, or only about $8 more per year, than the price currently paid for default service of mostly nuclear and dirty coal-generated power.\n\nThe end of CTCs in Duquesne's territory will allow a residential customer to switch from traditional, dirty generation to renewable generation and still save money, or pay only pennies more.\n\nBusiness and Institutional Customers\nThe dollar impact for larger customers is somewhat higher, but equally small in the context of total electricity bills or company budgets. For example, a small commercial customer on rate GS/M, such as a restaurant or convenience store, using 10,000 kWh per month and with a demand of 23 kW, has been paying $808.52 per month for regulated or default service. \n\nWith elimination of the CTC and the PJM-West integration costs, their bills will likely decrease about 11 percent, for a total monthly bill of about $720, a savings of about $88 per month. A small commercial customer could use the savings to buy enough wind energy to meet 25 percent of its load - saving about $26 per month compared to present bills, and still paying less for electricity than in 1996.\n\nA large commercial/industrial customer on rate GL, such as a large hotel, hospital or a small college or manufacturer, using 1.168 million kWh/month and a demand of 2,000 kW has been paying about $69,440 per month for regulated or default service. With elimination of the CTC, the bill will likely decrease about 8 percent beginning around September, 2002, for a total monthly bill of around $63,900; a savings of about $5,540 per month. \n\nThose substantial savings could then be invested in purchasing renewable energy without increasing electricity bills above either current or 1996 levels. For example, a hospital could serve 30 percent of its load with a blended product for 5.5 cents/kWh and still save about $1,225 per month compared to its current default bill. Two hospitals could purchase the entire output of one of the new wind turbines in southwestern Pennsylvania to supply over 15 percent of their total electricity requirements and still save about $5,200 per month compared to their present bills. Even if a single hospital purchased the output of an entire wind turbine, enough to serve 31.4 percent of its load, the total additional cost of $3,209 per month would be only about $3,840 more per year than their current default bill.\n\nFor hospitals, which must fight the devastating health effects of dirty coal-generated power every day, how much is that worth?\n\nMunicipal consumers on rate SM for street lighting, using 110,000 kWh per month, have been paying $33,130 per month for regulated and default electricity. With elimination of the CTC, the bill would decrease to $27,220, but with the PJM-West transition costs the bill may decrease about 14.5 percent, for a total monthly bill of $28,320; a savings of about $4,810 per month.  About three municipal customers with that consumption level could join together to purchase the output of one of the new wind turbines in southwestern Pennsylvania to meet their entire electricity load and still save about $2,850 per month each, compared to their current default costs. A single municipal customer could still save about $880 per month compared to their current bill if they purchased a blended product at 6.0 cents per kWh. \n\nWhat *is* it worth?\nWhat will renewable energy be worth to Pittsburgh's families, businesses, institutions and governments? Buying renewable is the single best thing any consumer can do to protect our environment and public health. Its value is great and its price in Pittsburgh will become less distorted with the removal of stranded cost charges from consumers' bills next year. The savings of $20 per month for a typical residential customer and much more for typical commercial, industrial, and municipal accounts, gives Pittsburgh a great opportunity to become America's first green-powered city. The price of that opportunity will cost less than what consumers paid for dirty power in 1996 or even what many are paying now. \n\nThe value of that opportunity is priceless. \n\n---------------------------------\nE-cubed is available for reprint in newspapers and other publications.

         "MTAYLO1 (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nThanks for your note.  I've been thinking about you guys a lot, too.  I haven't been back to NYC since I left on the QE2 on 9/4.  Every time I heard about the conditions downtown I assumed you would be living in the country.  Sorry to hear you had to spend so much time in a hotel.  I know what that can be like and it loses any appeal it ever had very quickly.  Also sorry to hear about Mrs. B.  I hope she is doing better.\n\nIt has been chaotic and very depressing here -- not that our acquisition deal went through but that we ever got in the position to need the deal to go through in the first place.  In fact, when they finally announced it, my primary feeling was one of relief.  Things had gotten very bad.  Next time we get together I can fill you in on all the details.  At least for now I am still employed and my prospects are pretty good under the circumstances.\n\nIt's nice you have Key West to get away to.  You'll have to tell me about the house that you have available but under the circumstances I doubt that I could get away often enough to justify taking on a lease.  It would be nice to get away from here now and then though.  I was supposed to go to Ft. Lauderdale (did you know Ted was living there now?) a few weeks ago to visit and go to the big boat show there.  That trip had to be cancelled in all the confusion around here.  I had hoped to be in New York today for a seminar (where I was actually scheduled to speak) but cancelled that also.  With luck things will start to get back to normal here soon.  I'm really feeling the need for a break (and 4 days in Cincinnati next week don't count) so maybe I can come visit some time in the next couple of months.\n\nTell Don I said Hi.\n\nMark\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \t\"Hal Bromm\" <halbromm@hotmail.com>@ENRON  \nSent:\tSaturday, November 10, 2001 9:20 PM\nTo:\tTaylor, Mark E (Legal)\nSubject:\tHow are you ?\n\nMark,\nYou have been in mind for days, longer in fact.

Let me know how you are and what is happening.\nNo doubt you will survive the mess, but hope it is not taking too much out\nof you.\n\nWe are slowly getting back to normal, and every trip out of NY it great as I\nam very tired of police check points and ID's.  Our building is livable now\nfor about a month, but still behind a barricade.  My mother has been in and\nout of hospital, and so that has kept me stressed.  I sold a house in KW in\nlate Sept, so came down then for the closing.  Hated going back to NY as we\nwere still living in a hotel then....\n\nI am in KW now, much enjoying being able to work here but missing Don.  Back\nto NY next week, then here again end of month.  Planning a new addition on\nthe house, which is trying.

But it is extremely important that we \npick up the missing the Gas Daily Deals.  There are 8 missing deals from \nMarch 28 and 26 missing deals from yesterday.  This throws our deal count, \nvolume and value off for the upper management report that people like Louise, \nSally Beck and Skilling see everyday.  Attached are the 26 deals from \nyesterday.  I need to know which officialized Post Id that they are in.\n\nPlease get back to me as soon as possible.  I will appreciate any help you \ncan give.\n\n\n\nCarrie\n",

Dear Carol

Under Bermuda law, there is no real concept of ""perfecting"" security since it 
is not necessary to ensure the enforceability in Bermuda that a charge be 
registered in Bermuda.  However, although it is not necessary for a security 
interest to be registered in order for it to be valid, the charge document 
itself can be registered in Bermuda in the Register of Charges in accordance 
with Section 55 of the Companies Act 1981 in order to ensure the priority in 
Bermuda of the charge.  On registration, any charge evidenced in the charging 
document will have priority over any unregistered competing charge or any 
subsequently registered competing charge in respect of the assets which are 
the subject of the charge (i.e. the cash).

If the agreement will be governed by either Texas or New York law, it will be 
a matter of the laws of either Texas or New York as to the actual nature of 
the security interest which is created by the charge.

If you would like us to effect the registration of the charge, we would need 
an original (or a certified true copy) of the executed document which creates 
the security interest.  There is no time limit on such registration.  
However, please note that, in addition to our professional fees, there is a 
filing fee of $446 which is payable in respect of the registration.

I trust that the above is of some assistance.  If you have any questions 
please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards.

Subject: Project Stanley - History of the Design of the Alberta Power Pool 
Model

I understand your call to me yesterday was to inquire about the vision the 
architects of the Power Pool of Alberta had when they were setting up the 
Power Pool, and more particularly, whether they envisioned that 
unsophisticated Pool Participant would be expected to obtain assistance from 
other more sophisticated Pool Participants to maximize the price that it 
would receive from the Power Pool for the energy it sold into the Power 
Pool.    I have reviewed the some materials (i.e. AEUB Decisions, Alberta 
Department of Energy documents) and have found nothing related to this.  This 
is not surprising as these market design issues were considered in Alberta in 
1994 and 1995, long before I arrived on the electricity scene in 1997.

I did speak to a consultant who was involved in the market design process in 
the early 1990's named Jim Fitzowich.  Jim joined TransAlta in 1986 and then 
worked for TransCanada Power until January 2000 when he established his 
current consulting practice.  Jim became a member of the Power Pool Council 
in late 1995 and stayed in that position until May 1998 when an independent 
Power Pool Council was appointed.  Jim and I are both on the Board of 
Directors of the Independent Power Producers Society of Alberta and I know 
Jim fairly well.  

Jim advised that the Alberta electricity industry design was quarterbacked by 
the Deputy Minister of Energy of the day named Rick Hyndman.  Under Rick 
Hyndman's direction a White Paper was apparently released in October 1994 in 
which a power exchange regime modelled on the exchange regime in the U.K. was 
thoroughly discussed and proposed for Alberta.   According to Jim Fitzowich, 
this White Paper was the initial blueprint for the Alberta market design.  I 
have met Rick Hyndman a few times and understand he left government a few 
years ago and is also a consultant.  I left Rick a message to call me and I 
intend to ask him to send me a copy of the White Paper and also inquire about 
the nature of his consulting work.  

On a related note, attached is an email I sent to Bill G and John L in March 
2000 advising them of the new Power Pool Participant Behavior Guidelines that 
were added to the Power Pool Rules in March 2000.  You can see the original 
notice of the rule change received from the Power Pool is also attached as 
are the actual Participant Behavior Guidelines (see Change 11a).  While I 
appreciate the determination of whether an offence occurred under the 
Competition Act would be independent of the compliance, or not, with the 
Power Pool Rules, I think it is noteworthy that the Power Pool incorporated 
these entirely new set of Participant Behavior Guidelines only recently, and 
after the acts that are the subject of Project Stanley had occurred.     

You should also be aware that there is a document on the Power Pool website 
(http://www.powerpool.ab.ca/index_links.html) entitled ""Summary of Power Pool 
Rule Changes"" that appears to list all the rule changes that have occurred 
since the Power Pool began operation in 1996.

Rob

To: Bill Greenizan/CAL/ECT@ECT, John J Lavorato/CAL/ECT@ECT
cc: Aleck Dadson/TOR/ECT@ECT, Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT@ECT 
Subject: Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes

Attached are a number of Pool Rule Changes that I expect will be approved 
today by the Power Pool Council.  The most noteworthy change is the addition 
of the new Rule 2.9 - ""Participant Behavior Guidelines"".

The Participant Behavior Guidelines contain very broad language but are 
intended to provide market participants with guidance from the Pool on the 
types of activities that it considers to constitute anti-competitive 
behavior.    It identifies three categories of ""undesireable practices"" 
namely: (a) sharing of competitive information, (b) abuse of dominant 
position (which includes physical or economic witholding of facilities or 
energy so as to adversely impact upon the efficient, fair, and openly 
competitive operation of the market), and (c) other practices including 
conduct that would cause a material change in price.

In my view, this new Rule does not extend any additional powers to the Power 
Pool or the Market Survelliance Administrator beyond the already broad 
authority given to the MSA in Section 9.1 of the Electric Utilities Act.  It 
is my sense from conversations I had with stakeholders at the IPPSA 
Conference that the Power Pool's motivation behind this new Rule was to send 
a message to Powerex and the PPA Owners that the Power Pool is concerned 
about their market power and is/will be monitoring them.   We need to be 
aware of these rules so we can mitigate the risk of our business not being 
conducted within them.  

It may be worthwhile for Peter and I to consolidate the relevant EUA 
provisions and the Pool Rules into one reference resource for the commercial 
group.   

Regards,

Rob

Department of Energy documents) and have found nothing related to this.  This 
is not surprising as these market design issues were considered in Alberta in 
1994 and 1995, long before I arrived on the electricity scene in 1997.

I did speak to a consultant who was involved in the market design process in 
the early 1990's named Jim Fitzowich.  Jim joined TransAlta in 1986 and then 
worked for TransCanada Power until January 2000 when he established his 
current consulting practice.  Jim became a member of the Power Pool Council 
in late 1995 and stayed in that position until May 1998 when an independent 
Power Pool Council was appointed.  Jim and I are both on the Board of 
Directors of the Independent Power Producers Society of Alberta and I know 
Jim fairly well.  

Jim advised that the Alberta electricity industry design was quarterbacked by 
the Deputy Minister of Energy of the day named Rick Hyndman.  Under Rick 
Hyndman's direction a White Paper was apparently released in October 1994 in 
which a power exchange regime modelled on the exchange regime in the U.K. was 
thoroughly discussed and proposed for Alberta.   According to Jim Fitzowich, 
this White Paper was the initial blueprint for the Alberta market design.  I 
have met Rick Hyndman a few times and understand he left government a few 
years ago and is also a consultant.  I left Rick a message to call me and I 
intend to ask him to send me a copy of the White Paper and also inquire about 
the nature of his consulting work.  

On a related note, attached is an email I sent to Bill G and John L in March 
2000 advising them of the new Power Pool Participant Behavior Guidelines that 
were added to the Power Pool Rules in March 2000.  You can see the original 
notice of the rule change received from the Power Pool is also attached as 
are the actual Participant Behavior Guidelines (see Change 11a).  While I 
appreciate the determination of whether an offence occurred under the 
Competition Act would be independent of the compliance, or not, with the 
Power Pool Rules, I think it is noteworthy that the Power Pool incorporated 
these entirely new set of Participant Behavior Guidelines only recently, and 
after the acts that are the subject of Project Stanley had occurred.     

You should also be aware that there is a document on the Power Pool website 
(http://www.powerpool.ab.ca/index_links.html) entitled ""Summary of Power Pool 
Rule Changes"" that appears to list all the rule changes that have occurred 
since the Power Pool began operation in 1996.

Rob

Subject: Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes

Attached are a number of Pool Rule Changes that I expect will be approved 
today by the Power Pool Council.  The most noteworthy change is the addition 
of the new Rule 2.9 - ""Participant Behavior Guidelines"".

The Participant Behavior Guidelines contain very broad language but are 
intended to provide market participants with guidance from the Pool on the 
types of activities that it considers to constitute anti-competitive 
behavior.    It identifies three categories of ""undesireable practices"" 
namely: (a) sharing of competitive information, (b) abuse of dominant 
position (which includes physical or economic witholding of facilities or 
energy so as to adversely impact upon the efficient, fair, and openly 
competitive operation of the market), and (c) other practices including 
conduct that would cause a material change in price.

In my view, this new Rule does not extend any additional powers to the Power 
Pool or the Market Survelliance Administrator beyond the already broad 
authority given to the MSA in Section 9.1 of the Electric Utilities Act.  It 
is my sense from conversations I had with stakeholders at the IPPSA 
Conference that the Power Pool's motivation behind this new Rule was to send 
a message to Powerex and the PPA Owners that the Power Pool is concerned 
about their market power and is/will be monitoring them.   We need to be 
aware of these rules so we can mitigate the risk of our business not being 
conducted within them.  

It may be worthwhile for Peter and I to consolidate the relevant EUA 
provisions and the Pool Rules into one reference resource for the commercial 
group.   

Regards,

Rob

Subject: Re: Contacts

Sheila, as discussed yesterday, I need to do the following:

Open a brokerage account at Morgan Stanley for Enron de Inversiones de 
Energia S.C.A. (an Argentine company) (EDIDE)
This account will hold ADRs that will be contributed or transferred into its 
account by Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A.  (EPCA)(account #038-088357) 
at Morgan Stanley.
EPCA will contribute 431,300 ADRs in Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) into 
EDIDE's new account.  That contribution represents the capital contribution 
that EPCA is obligated to make under the capital increase resolution dated 
February 20th, 2000.
After the ADR's are transferred into EDIDE's accounts, EDIDE will need to 
convert such ADR's into ordinary Class B shares in TGS so that they can be 
registered accordingly in Argentina.

Sheila, I am forwarding a hard copy of this e-mail with appropriate support 
(corporate resolutions authorizing me to open this account, resolution 
authorizing the increase in capital and some forms that I had Eduardo 
Ojea-Quintana (President of EDIDE) sign).

Please review and advise of what else you need to finalize this transaction.

Best Regards,

RFR

agreement has been finalized, for report lists from your key applications, 
those
being, Altra GMS and Risk Works( there may be others as people become more

ISO FALL 1999 UFE PROJECT
RETROACTIVE MARKET ADJUSTMENT ANNOUNCEMENT

June 15, 2000

MARKET PARTICIPANTS & SC SETTLEMENT CONTACTS;

NOTIFICATION OF RETRO-ACTIVE 1999 UFE MARKET CORRECTION

On July 3, 2000, the ISO, consistent with its commitment to the Market
Participants, will initiate Unaccounted for Energy (UFE) market adjustments,
for Market Settlements from August 21, 1999 through December 31, 1999.

These adjustments result from the correction of  meter data errors,
identified and corrected by the ISO UFE Project. The Market Participants
have been very cooperative in working with the ISO.  The mutual objectives
were to assure accurate settlement of Imbalance Energy, to rectify start-up
meter data management problems and to minimize UFE.

The overall magnitude of erroneous UFE identified by the ISO UFE Project is
approximately 1,100,000 MWhs or $ 70,000,000.  The ISO Settlements and
Metering Department staffs are in the process of recalculating the specific
market charges impacted, for this period.

Actual retro-active UFE adjustments will commence on July 3, 2000, and be
applied initially to the May 9th Preliminary Settlement Statement (PSS). The
ISO's intention is to correct 15 settlement days per week over the next 10
weeks until the entire 1999 August 21-December 31 period settlements are
corrected.  The ISO Settlements system time required to rerun settlements
constrains our ability to proceed more expeditiously.  However, we do plan
completion by the end of Summer.


The ISO will apply retroactive adjustments to ALL UFE related Market
charges. The erroneous UFE identified by the ISO UFE Project will be charged
to the responsible Scheduling Coordinators (SCs), to help assure that no
adverse market impact occurs from cost shifting.  Other SCs will receive the
associated charge type credits.



FINAL REPORT TO MARKET PARTICIPANTS - Fall 1999 ISO UFE PROJECT

On August 21, 1999, UFE in the PG&E Service Area increased substantially,
ranging from 4-15 %.   This inordinately high UFE continued in excess of
typical amounts of UFE for this UDC Service Area (-1 to +1%), for four
months.

The ISO actively investigated potential systemic causes for this order of
magnitude increase in UFE.

ISO efforts consisted of a concerted review of SQMD submitted by SC's during
this period, a review of the ISO MDAS polled meter data for ISO metered
entities, a review of interchange data (exports), a review of the
Transmission Loss calculations used by ISO Settlements to calculate UFE by
UDC, an investigation of the Market Redesign Settlements software changes
associated with the drop of new Settlements software in mid- August and the
retention of a data consultant to help identify and isolate any causal
factor, attributable for the high UFE .


The effort to identify UFE related settlement issues for the period of
August 21, 1999 through December 31, 1999 is complete.  The ISO UFE Project
team, working in conjunction with Market Participants, identified over 1.1
million MWH of erroneous UFE. This UFE is now accounted for, and will be
reassigned to the responsible SCs. The ISO Project identified over 14 casual
sources of UFE during this period.  Many of the issues identified were
interrelated.

The last major source of UFE for the period was identified in April. This
UFE resulted from an erroneous Validation, Editing and Estimating (VEE)
factor, applied to firm load within the PG&E Service Area.  This error,
associated with late or missed meter data adjustment, commenced October 1,
1999 and resulted in understated SC load of approximately 100 - 267 MW/hour,
through December.

The balance of the SC meter data management errors previously identified
were attributable to the complexity of using Pseudo Resources and Logical
Metering to model, schedule and settle Municipal UDC existing contracts
(ETCs).

The four primary SCs which experienced meter data problems, within the PG&E
UDC Service Area, have resubmitted corrected Settlement Quality Meter Data
(SQMD).

The ISO will initiate retroactive UFE Market adjustments for the Settlement
period of August 21,1999 through December 31, 1999.  The magnitude of the
Market UFE adjustment is approximately $70 million. These retro-active
Market adjustments will complete the Project Team's work on the Fall 1999
UFE issue.


Present UFE Status:

March 2000 UFE, based upon Final Settlement Statements (FSS), is as follows:

System UFE         +
0.22 %
PG&E UDC Service Area UFE   + 0.17 %
SCE UDC Service Area UFE    + 0.44 %
SDG&E UDC Service Area UFE   -  0.45%

ISO FALL 1999 UFE PROJECT
RETROACTIVE MARKET ADJUSTMENT ANNOUNCEMENT

June 15, 2000

MARKET PARTICIPANTS & SC SETTLEMENT CONTACTS;

NOTIFICATION OF RETRO-ACTIVE 1999 UFE MARKET CORRECTION

On July 3, 2000, the ISO, consistent with its commitment to the Market
Participants, will initiate Unaccounted for Energy (UFE) market adjustments,
for Market Settlements from August 21, 1999 through December 31, 1999.

These adjustments result from the correction of  meter data errors,
identified and corrected by the ISO UFE Project. The Market Participants
have been very cooperative in working with the ISO.  The mutual objectives
were to assure accurate settlement of Imbalance Energy, to rectify start-up
meter data management problems and to minimize UFE.

The overall magnitude of erroneous UFE identified by the ISO UFE Project is
approximately 1,100,000 MWhs or $ 70,000,000.  The ISO Settlements and
Metering Department staffs are in the process of recalculating the specific
market charges impacted, for this period.

Actual retro-active UFE adjustments will commence on July 3, 2000, and be
applied initially to the May 9th Preliminary Settlement Statement (PSS). The
ISO's intention is to correct 15 settlement days per week over the next 10
weeks until the entire 1999 August 21-December 31 period settlements are
corrected.  The ISO Settlements system time required to rerun settlements
constrains our ability to proceed more expeditiously.  However, we do plan
completion by the end of Summer.


The ISO will apply retroactive adjustments to ALL UFE related Market
charges. The erroneous UFE identified by the ISO UFE Project will be charged
to the responsible Scheduling Coordinators (SCs), to help assure that no
adverse market impact occurs from cost shifting.  Other SCs will receive the
associated charge type credits.
